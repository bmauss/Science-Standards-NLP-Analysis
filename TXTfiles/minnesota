                             Minnesota Academic Standards in Science
                                                   Introduction
The 2009 Minnesota Academic Standards in Science set the expectations for achievement in science for K-12
students in Minnesota. The standards are grounded in the belief that all students can and should be scientifically
literate. Scientific literacy enables people to use scientific principles and processes to make personal decisions
and to participate in discussions of scientific issues that affect society (NRC, 1996). The standards and
benchmarks describe a connected body of science and engineering knowledge acquired through active
participation in science experiences. These experiences include hands-on laboratory activities rooted in scientific
inquiry and engineering design. The standards are placed at the grade level where mastery is expected with
recognition that a progression of learning experiences in earlier grades builds the foundation for mastery later
on.
The Minnesota Academic Standards in Science are organized by grade level into four content strands: 1) The
Nature of Science and Engineering, 2) Physical Science, 3) Earth and Space Science, and 4) Life Science. It is
important to note that the content and skills in The Nature of Science and Engineering are not intended to be
taught as a stand-alone unit or an isolated course, but embedded and used in the teaching, learning and
assessment of the content in the other strands. Each strand has three or four substrands. Each substrand
contains two or more standards and one or more benchmarks. The benchmarks supplement the standards by
specifying the academic knowledge and skills that schools must offer and students must achieve to satisfactorily
complete a standard. Not all standards are found at every grade level. The strands, substrands and standards are
organized as follows.

The standards are written as statements of content, and the benchmarks are written as learning outcomes. Each
standard should be prefaced with the statement, “The student will understand that…”.
Many of the benchmarks include examples that clarify the meaning of the benchmark or indicate the level of student
understanding. The examples may suggest learning activities or instructional topics. They are NOT intended to be
directives for curriculum or a comprehensive fulfillment of the benchmarks.
The benchmarks for each standard are designated by five(5)-digit codes. For example, in the code 3.1.1.2.1—
     •   The 3 refers to grade 3;
     •   The first 1 refers to the first strand, The Nature of Science and Engineering;
     •   The next 1 refers to the first substrand, The Practice of Science;
     •   The 2 refers to the second standard in that substrand, Scientific inquiry is…;
     •   The last 1 refers to the first benchmark for that standard, Generate questions that… .

Codes that begin with “9” indicate benchmarks that are to be mastered in grades 9-12. Benchmarks that satisfy the
new one-credit requirement for chemistry or physics (effective for the graduating class of 2015 and beyond) are
indicated by codes beginning with “9C,” or “9P” respectively. Chemistry and physics have additional standards
beyond those depicted in the chart on Page 1.
These standards are to be implemented no later than the 2011-12 school year. For further information, please refer
