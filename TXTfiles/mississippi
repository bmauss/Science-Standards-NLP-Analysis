                                              Mission Statement
The Mississippi Department of Education is dedicated to student success, which includes improving student
achievement in science, equipping citizens to solve complex problems, and establishing fluent
communication skills within a technological environment. The Mississippi College‐ and Career‐Readiness
Standards provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to know and be able to
do by the end of each grade level or course. The standards are designed to be robust and relevant to the
real world, reflecting the knowledge and skills that students need for success in college and careers and
allowing students to compete in the global economy.
                                                    Purpose
In an effort to closely align instruction for students who are progressing toward postsecondary study and
the workforce, the 2018 Mississippi College- and Career-Readiness Standards for Science includes grade-
and course-specific standards for K-12 science.
This document is designed to provide K-12 science teachers with a basis for curriculum development. In
order to prepare students for careers and college, it outlines what knowledge students should obtain, and
the types of skills students must master upon successful completion of each grade level. The 2018
Mississippi College- and Career-Readiness Standards (MS CCRS) for Science replaces the 2010 Mississippi
Science Framework. These new standards reflect national expectations while focusing on postsecondary
success, but they are unique to Mississippi in addressing the needs of our students and teachers. The
standards’ content centers around three basic content strands of science: life science, physical science, and
Earth and space science. Instruction in these areas is designed for a greater balance between content and
process. Teachers are encouraged to transfer more ownership of the learning process to students, who can
then direct their own learning and develop a deeper understanding of science and engineering practices,
critical analysis, and knowledge. Doing so will produce students that will become more capable,
independent, and scientifically literate adults.
                                                Implementation
The 2018 Mississippi College- and Career-Readiness Standards (MS CCRS) for Science will be implemented
during the 2018-2019 school year.

                            Research and Background Information
In today’s modern world and complex society, our students are required to possess sufficient knowledge of
science and engineering to become vigilant consumers of scientific and technological information. To meet
the growing challenges facing our future workforce, the National Research Council (NRC) published a
research-based report on teaching and learning science in a 2012 document titled A Framework for K-12
Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas (NRC, 2012). This document proposes a
new approach to K-12 science education through the integration of science and engineering practices
(SEPs), crosscutting concepts, disciplinary core ideas, and engineering design within the context of science
instruction.
        Core Elements in the Use and Design of the MS CCRS for Science
The MS CCRS for Science are goals that reflect what a student should know and be able to do. This
document does not dictate a manner or methods of teaching. The standards in this document are not
sequenced for instruction and do not prescribe classroom activities, materials, or instruction strategies.
These standards are end-of year expectations for each grade or course. The standards are intended to drive
relevant and rigorous instruction that emphasizes student mastery of both disciplinary core ideas
(concepts) and application of science and engineering practices (skills) to support student readiness for
citizenship, college, and careers.
The MS CCRS for Science document was built by adapting and extending information from A Framework for
K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas (NRC, 2012) and combining with
Mississippi’s previous science framework process strands (i.e., science as inquiry, unifying concepts and
processes, science and technology, science in personal and social perspectives, and the history and nature
of science). These concepts connect information across the science content strands (i.e., life science,
physical science, and Earth and space science) with the disciplinary core ideas (e.g., ecology and
interdependence, motions, forces, and energy, Earth systems and cycles) and are essential to both
scientists and engineers because they identify common properties and processes found in practice.
The core elements are integrated across standards and performance objectives in each grade and course. A
brief description of each core element is presented below.
     1. Nature of Science: Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs) replaced the Inquiry Strand included in
         the 2010 Mississippi Science Framework. Beyond integration within the standards, these practices
         must be mastered by students to produce a more scientifically literate citizenry and to develop
         students that are more excited about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
         topics and careers. Inquiry verbs, along with the SEPs, are woven throughout the standards,
         especially in the performance objectives. Each has a deliberate placement to indicate the depth of
         understanding expected of students.
         The practices describe the behaviors that scientists engage in as they investigate and build models
         and theories about the natural world. They also describe the key set of engineering practices that
         engineers use as they design and build models and systems. These practices work together (overlap
         and interconnect) and are not separated in the study and investigation of science concepts. For
         example, the practice of mathematical and computational thinking may include some aspects of
         analyzing and interpreting data. The data often come from planning and carrying out an
         investigation. The writing task force for the MS CCRS for Science incorporated this language into the
       11   Overview of MS CCRS for Science


      MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                            2018
    performance objectives to emphasize the importance of a student-centered science classroom and
    not a teacher-centered classroom. A list of these eight practices is listed below.
          a.  Ask Questions (science) and Define Problems (engineering)
          b.  Develop and Use Models
          c.  Plan and Conduct Investigations
          d.  Analyze and Interpret Data
          e.  Use Mathematical and Computational Thinking
          f.  Construct Explanations (science) and Design Solutions (engineering)
          g.  Engage in Scientific Argument from Evidence
          h.  Obtain, Evaluate, and Communicate Information
2. Crosscutting concepts: These seven, binding concepts were adopted directly from the National
    Research Council’s A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and
    Core Ideas (2012) and should be woven into instruction for every grade and course. Crosscutting
    concepts are designed to help students see the unity of the sciences. Students often are confused
    when they study ecosystems for three weeks, then weather for two weeks, and finally motion and
    forces for several weeks. A concept is crosscutting if it communicates a scientific way of thinking
    about a subject and it applies to many different disciplines of science and engineering. Crosscutting
    concepts are sometimes called “the ties that bind.” The seven concepts are listed below.
          a.  Patterns
          b.  Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation
          c.  Scale, proportion, and quantity
          d.  Systems and system models
          e.  Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation
          f.  Structure and function
          g.  Stability and change
3. Technology: If Mississippi students are to compete on a global stage and exit high school prepared
    for college, career, and life, technology should be used in the classroom in a way that suits 21st-
    century learners and reflects the modern workplace. Technology is essential in teaching and
    learning of science; it influences and enhances students’ learning. Flexible access, customized
    delivery, and increased convenience for the user are core tenets. K-12 learners have fundamentally
    changed over the past few decades, and our classrooms should adapt to accommodate them. Dr.
    Ruben Puentedura’s SAMR (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition) model is a
    resource that can be considered by teachers, administrators, and technology staff as they integrate
    meaningful and appropriate digital learning experiences into the classroom. At the basic level,
    technology enhances instruction.
4. Science and society: This core element assures exploration of science’s impacts on society and the
    feedback loop that must be cultivated and sustained to continue improvement of systems.
5. History of science: Because most modern-day scientific advancement derives from past discoveries,
    it is essential that students understand the breakthroughs that make today’s work possible.
6. Engineering design process (EDP) is the method of devising a system, component, or process to
    meet desired needs. Engineering standards are represented in some performance objectives with
    grade-banded, specific wording that prompts educators to approach learning and exploration using
    the engineering process. These performance objectives are marked with an *. It is important to
  12     Overview of MS CCRS for Science


           MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                            2018
         note that the EDP is flexible. Most students will approach the process in various ways. The EDP is
         also a cycle—there is no official start or end point. Students can begin at any step, focus on just one
         step, move back and forth between steps, or repeat the cycle. Professional development and
         teacher resources will be developed for Mississippi teachers as EDP is incorporated into Mississippi
         standards.
         Students should be provided a safe environment for failure without consequence, which is one of
         the most powerful drivers in learning. Providing many opportunities for students to fail, learn, and
         try again, with appropriate levels of support, fosters a deeper level of understanding and greater
         student interest and engagement.
Other Important Core Elements
Mathematics is integrated throughout the science standards document because it is essential to the
scientific process, requiring students to quantify, analyze, and present results. Students must be familiar
with data analysis, critical thinking, and recording their own data; students must organize and analyze it
before presenting their findings. Analysis of scientific studies and publications from a quantitative
perspective is also very important.
English/language arts skills are also integrated into the science standards. Students will be required to read
informational text for understanding as well as process and critique information. Students must be able to
articulate a critical point of view using proper terminology. In addition, the K-4 science curriculum should
be increasingly tied to language arts to lay the foundation for students to have access to science before fifth
grade.
                        Content Strands and Disciplinary Core Ideas
Science (and engineering) fields can be divided into three content-strand domains based on relative
content presented in strands, extending from kindergarten to eighth grade. Grouping content in this way
allows for vertical alignment of competencies and objectives to better organize content distribution.
Content strands are not included in the Grades 9-12 course organization, which allows for a more logical,
sequential placement and flow of content. Content strands are subdivided into 10 disciplinary core ideas in
which standards and performance objectives for science content can be placed in grades K-8.
K-8 content strands with the 10 disciplinary core ideas include:
Life Science
     1. Hierarchical Organization
     2. Reproduction and Heredity
     3. Ecology and Interdependence
     4. Adaptations and Diversity
Physical Science
     5. Organization of Matter and Chemical Interactions
     6. Motions, Forces, and Energy
Earth and Space Science
     7. Earth’s Structure and History
     8. Earth and the Universe
     9. Earth Systems and Cycles
     10. Earth’s Resources

          MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                              2018
                           Structure of the Standards Document
The organization and structure of this standards document are as follows:
    ●   Grade-band overview: An overview that describes the general content and themes for the grade-
        level band or the high school courses. Outputs and outcomes are provided along with examples of,
        and references to, science and engineering practices and connecting concepts.
    ●   Grade-level or course overview: An overview that describes the specific content and themes for
        each grade level and/or high school course. The K-8 standards are presented with each grade
        focused on a grade-level theme. High school courses provide an overview of the major ideas and
        strategies to use when planning instruction for the course.
    ●   Content strand: Domains into which science fields can be divided based on relative content
        extending from kindergarten to eighth grade. In grades K through 8, the content strands are
        organized into three distinct areas: (1) life science, (2) physical science, and (3) Earth and space
        science. For the Grade 9-12 courses, the content areas are organized around the core ideas of each
        course.
    ●   Disciplinary core ideas: Subdivision of the main content strands providing recurring ideas from the
        three content strands. The core ideas are the key organizing principles for the development of
        learning units. The K-8 vertical alignment is designed in a spiral arrangement, which places
        emphasis on one of the three content strands in each grade level. All content strands will be found
        in each grade level, but all disciplinary core ideas will not be found in every grade level in K-8 due to
        the spiral arrangement of content.
    ●   Conceptual understanding: Statements of the core ideas for which student should demonstrate an
        understanding. Some grade level and/or course topics include more than one conceptual
        understanding with each guiding the intent of the standards.
    •   Content standards: Written below each disciplinary core ideas and conceptual understanding, the
        standards are a general statement of what students should know and be able to do because of
        instruction.
    ●   Performance objectives: Detailed statements of content and skills to be mastered by the students.
        Performance objectives are specific statements of what students know and can do because of the
        science instruction at that level. These statements contain SEP and inquiry verb language.
Standards will appear in the following format:
Grade-Band Overview
Grade Level Theme (K-8)
Grade Level (K-8) or Course Overview (9-12)
Grade Level: Content Strand (K-8); Course Name (9-12)
    Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI)
    Conceptual Understanding
    Standard
    Performance Objectives

                                Safety in the Science Classroom
The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) encourages K–12 school leaders and teachers to promote
and support the use of science activities in science instruction and work to avoid and reduce injury. NSTA
provides the following guidelines for school leaders and teachers to develop safety programs that include
the effective management of chemicals, implement safety training for teachers and others, and create
school environments that are as safe as possible (NSTA 2013).
    1) National Science Teacher Association’s Safety in the Science Classroom, accessible at
         http://www.nsta.org/docs/SafetyInTheScienceClassroom.pdf.
    2) An extensive list of safety resources is available at http://www.nsta.org/safety/.
                              Support Documents and Resources
The MDE will develop support documents after these standards have been approved by the State Board of
Education. Local districts, schools, and teachers may use these documents to construct standards-based
science curriculum, allowing them to customize content to fit their students’ needs and match available
instructional materials. The support documents will include suggested resources, instructional strategies,
essential knowledge, and detailed information about the core elements (e.g., SEPs, crosscutting concepts).

            MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                         2018
Professional development efforts will be aligned with the standards and delivered in accord with teacher
resources to help expand expertise in delivering student-centered lessons (e.g., inquiry-based learning, 5-E
instructional models, or other best practices in STEM teaching). The most successful national models and
programs will be referenced for a capacity-building effort that can develop a more effective culture of
science education in Mississippi.
Investigate, Apply, and Understand
It is important that the pedagogical paradigm of Mississippi’s science classroom reflects the nature of the
content being learned. The essence of science is natural to children and includes discovery, observation,
questioning, design, testing, failure, iteration, and hands-on application. Research-based approaches such
as inquiry-based (IB), project-based, and discovery learning are all pedagogical pathways that make sense,
especially in the science classroom. Mississippi’s science teachers are encouraged to embrace the growth
mindset and constantly seek to upgrade classroom approaches by experimenting and adopting methods
that excite students to learn and become functional, autonomous learners and contributors. Students
should be provided increased maneuverability in the classroom to formulate their own ideas to investigate
and understand the scientific and engineering design processes.

                                        GRADES K-2 OVERVIEW
Students in Grades K-2 are naturally curious about their world and learn best through hands-on
experiences. Teachers must consider the students’ developmental level to provide appropriate learning
experiences so that students will understand the nature of science. Therefore, investigations using the five
senses should be an integral part of scientific inquiry. Recognizing and observing patterns are also
important, and students should be given experiences with living things to help them build their scientific
understanding. Learning opportunities should also facilitate the development of language-process skills and
mathematical concepts, while the students develop the ability to observe and then communicate
observations. Students need to be supplied with the appropriate materials and equipment necessary to
complete scientific investigations.
Each grade is developed around a theme:
          • Kindergarten – Change in the Natural World
          • Grade 1 – Discovering Patterns and Constructing Explanations
          • Grade 2 – Systems, Order, and Organization
In kindergarten, students are introduced to the concept of change. They learn to generate questions,
conduct structured experiments, sort, classify, sequence, and predict to communicate those findings. In
first grade, students build on the knowledge gained from kindergarten and make deeper connections by
examining evidence, observing patterns, and formulating explanations. By second grade, students learn to
organize and categorize their findings, which establish a foundation for logical thinking. They also use
abstract reasoning and interpretation of observations to draw conclusions from their investigations.
The core science content utilizes hands-on classroom instruction to reinforce the seven crosscutting
concepts (i.e., patterns; cause and effect; scale, portion, and quantity; systems and system models; energy
and matter; structure and function; and stability and change).
SEPs are in life science, physical science, and Earth and space science. The SEPs are designed so that
students may develop skills and apply knowledge to solve real-life problems. While presented as distinct
skill sets, the eight practices intentionally overlap and interconnect as students explore the science
concepts. Some examples of specific skills students should develop in grades K-2 are listed below.
     1. Generate questions and investigate the differences between liquids and solids and develop
          awareness that a liquid can become a solid and vice versa.
     2. Develop and use models to predict weather conditions associated with seasonal patterns and
          changes.
     3. Conduct an investigation to provide evidence that vibrations create sound (e.g., pluck a guitar
          string) and that sound can create vibrations (e.g., feeling sound through a speaker).
     4. Analyze and interpret data from observations and measurements to describe local weather
          conditions (including temperature, wind, and forms of precipitation).
     5. Compare and measure the length of solid objects using technology and mathematical
          representations. Analyze and communicate findings.
     6. Construct an explanation for the general pattern of change in daily temperatures by measuring and
          calculating the difference between morning and afternoon temperatures.
     7. Obtain and evaluate informational texts and other media to generate and answer questions about
          water sources and human uses of clean water.

          MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                            2018
Curricula and instructions that integrate science and engineering practices should reflect the skills outlined
above.
The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a step-by-step method of devising a system, component, or process
to meet desired needs. This is similar to the “scientific method” which is taught to young scientists.
However, the EDP is a flexible process. Students can begin at any step, focus on just one step, move back
and forth between steps, or repeat the cycle. Engineering standards are represented in some performance
objectives with grade-banded, specific wording that will prompt students to approach learning and
exploration using the engineering process. These performance objectives are marked with an * at the end
of the statement. Professional development and teacher resources will be developed for teachers as EDP is
incorporated into Mississippi standards.
Each K-2 standard allows students to be active doers of science rather than passive observers. This
approach creates an opportunity for student learning and engages the pupil in the scientific investigation
process.

                                  Theme: Change in the Natural World
In kindergarten, students observe the changes in the natural world and identify how animals use their
senses to recognize the changes. As language and vocabulary develops, students recognize that plants and
animals change and report findings about the changes throughout the life cycle. Students conduct an
investigation to determine the needs of plants to grow and use quantitative measurement to chart growth
over time. Students learn that change occurs when plants and animals do not get the food, water, and
space needed for growth. Students develop and use models to describe the seasonal changes in the
environment. Students develop questions and conduct a structured investigation to determine how
sunlight affects the temperature of sand, soil, rocks, and water. Using an engineer design process, students
then construct a structure to reduce the temperature of a play area. Students recognize that scientists
observe changes in the natural world and use investigations, charts, drawings, sketches, and models to
communicate these changes. Students need to recognize that scientists observe the natural world and use
investigations, charts, drawings, sketches, and models to communicate ideas.
                                   KINDERGARTEN: Life Science
L.K.1 Hierarchical Organization
Conceptual Understanding: Objects in the environment can be classified as living and nonliving. Living
things include plants and animals. All living things reproduce, grow, develop, respond to stimuli, and die;
and nonliving things do not. Living things require air, food, water, and an environment in which to live.
Acting as scientists, students will observe the natural world and use investigations, charts, drawings,
sketches, and models to communicate ideas.
L.K.1A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of living and nonliving things.
L.K.1A.1     With teacher guidance, conduct an investigation of living organisms and nonliving objects in
             various real-world environments to define characteristics of living organisms that distinguish
             them from nonliving things (e.g., playground, garden, school grounds).
L.K.1A.2     With teacher support, gain an understanding that scientists are humans who use observations
             to learn about the natural world. Obtain information from informational text or other media
             about scientists who have made important observations about living things (e.g. Carl Linnaeus,
             John James Audubon, Jane Goodall).
Conceptual Understanding: All organisms have external parts. Different animals use their body parts in
different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find,
and take in food, water, and air. Animals (including humans) use their senses to learn about the world
around them.
L.K.1B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of how animals (including humans) use
             their physical features and their senses to learn about their environment.
L.K.1B.1     Develop and use models to exemplify how animals use their body parts to (a) obtain food and
             other resources, (b) protect themselves, and (c) move from place to place.
L.K.1B.2     Identify and describe examples of how animals use their sensory body parts (eyes to detect light
             and movement, ears to detect sound, skin to detect temperature and touch, tongue to taste,
             and nose to detect smell).

L.K.2 Reproduction and Heredity
Conceptual Understanding: Plants and animals change in form as they go through stages in the life cycle.
Young plants and animals are very much like their parents and other plants and animals of the same kind,
but they can also vary in many ways.
L.K.2        Students will demonstrate an understanding of how living things change in form as
             they go through the general stages of a life cycle.
L.K.2.1      Use informational text or other media to make observations about plants as they change during
             the life cycle (e.g., germination, growth, reproduction, and death) and use models (e.g.,
             drawing, writing, dramatization, or technology) to communicate findings.
L.K.2.2      Construct explanations using observations to describe and model the life cycle (birth, growth,
             adulthood, death) of a familiar mammal (e.g., dog, squirrel, rabbit, deer).
L.K.2.3      With teacher guidance, conduct a structured investigation to observe and measure (comparison
             of lengths) the changes in various individuals of a single plant species from seed germination to
             adult plant. Record observations using drawing or writing.
L.K.2.4      Use observations to explain that young plants and animals are like but not exactly like their
             parents (i.e., puppies look similar, but not exactly like their parents).
                                     KINDERGARTEN: Life Science
L.K.3 Ecology and Interdependence
Conceptual Understanding: The environment consists of many types of living things including plants and
animals. Living things depend on the land, water, and air to live and grow.
L.K.3A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of what animals and plants need to live
             and grow.
L.K.3A.1     With teacher guidance, conduct a structured investigation to determine what plants need to live
             and grow (water, light, and a place to grow). Measure growth by directly comparing plants with
             other objects.
L.K.3A.2     Construct explanations using observations to describe and report what animals need to live and
             grow (food, water, shelter, and space).
Conceptual Understanding: Interdependence exists between plants and animals within an environment.
Living things can only survive in areas where their needs for air, water, food, and shelter are met.
L.K.3B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the interdependence of living things
             and the environment in which they live.
L.K.3B.1     Observe and communicate that animals get food from plants or other animals. Plants make
             their own food and need light to live and grow.
L.K.3B.2     Create a model habitat which demonstrates interdependence of plants and animals using an
             engineering design process to define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the
             habitat.*

L.K.4 Adaptations and Diversity
Conceptual Understanding: When animals do not get what they need to survive, they will die. Some types
of plants and animals are now extinct because they were unable to adapt when the environment changed.
There are similarities between some present-day animals and extinct animals.
L.K.4        Students will demonstrate an understanding that some groups of plants and animals
             are no longer living (extinct) because they were unable to meet their needs for
             survival.
L.K.4.1      Obtain information from informational text or other media to document and report examples of
             different plants or animals that are extinct.
L.K.4.2      Observe and report how some present-day animals resemble extinct animals (i.e., elephants
             resemble wooly mammoths).
                                 KINDERGARTEN: Physical Science
P.K.5 Organization of Matter and Chemical Interactions
Conceptual Understanding: Matter exists in different states, including solid and liquid forms. Water can
exist as a solid or a liquid. Solid objects can be described and sorted according to their attributes. Different
properties are suited for different purposes.
P.K.5A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the solid and liquid states of matter.
P.K.5A.1     Generate questions and investigate the differences between liquids and solids and develop
             awareness that a liquid can become a solid and vice versa.
P.K.5A.2     Describe and compare the properties of different materials (e.g., wood, plastic, metal, cloth,
             paper) and classify these materials by their observable characteristics (visual, aural, or
             natural textural) and by their physical properties (weight, volume, solid or liquid, and sink or
             float).
Conceptual Understanding: Many objects can be built from a smaller set of pieces (e.g., blocks,
construction sets). Most objects can be broken down into various component pieces and any piece of
uniform matter (e.g., a sheet of paper, a block of wood,) can be subdivided into smaller pieces of the same
material. If pieces of the original object are damaged or removed, the object may not have the same
properties or work the same.
P.K.5B.      Students will demonstrate an understanding of how solid objects can be constructed
             from a smaller set.
P.K.5B.1     Use basic shapes and spatial reasoning to model large objects in the environment using a set of
             small objects (e.g., blocks, construction sets).
P.K.5B.2     Analyze a large composite structure to describe its smaller components using drawing and
             writing.
P.K.5B.3     Explain why things may not work the same if some of the parts are missing.

E.K.8 Earth and the Universe
Conceptual Understanding: Seasonal changes occur as the Earth orbits the sun. These seasonal changes
repeat in a pattern. Patterns of sunrise and sunset can be described and predicted.
E.K.8A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the pattern of seasonal changes on
             the Earth.
E.K.8A.1     Construct an explanation of the pattern of the Earth’s seasonal changes in the environment
             using evidence from observations.
Conceptual Understanding: The sun is the source of heat and light for the solar system. This heat can
impact Earth’s natural resources. Living things depend upon the effects of the sun (warms the land, air,
water, and helps plants grow) to survive.
E.K.8B       Students will demonstrate an understanding that the Sun provides the Earth with
             heat and light.
E.K.8B.1     With teacher guidance, generate and answer questions to develop a simple model, which
             describes observable patterns of sunlight on the Earth’s surface (day and night).
E.K.8B.2     With teacher guidance, develop questions to conduct a structured investigation to determine
             how sunlight affects the temperature of the Earth’s natural resources (e.g., sand, soil, rocks, and
             water).
E.K.8B.3     Develop a device (i.e., umbrella, shade structure, or hat) which would reduce heat from the sun
             (temperature) using an engineering design process to define the problem, design, construct,
             evaluate, and improve the device.*
                         KINDERGARTEN: Earth and Space Science
E.K.10 Earth’s Resources
Conceptual Understanding: Humans use Earth’s resources for everything they do. Choices that humans
make to live comfortably can affect the world around them. Recycling, reusing, and reducing consumption
of natural resources is important in protecting our Earth’s environment. Humans can make choices that
reduce their impact on Earth’s environment.
E.K.10       Students will demonstrate an understanding of how humans use Earth’s resources.
E.K.10.1     Participate in a teacher-led activity to gather, organize and record recyclable materials data on
             a chart or table using technology. Communicate results.
E.K.10.2     With teacher guidance, develop questions to conduct a structured investigation to determine
             ways to conserve Earth's resources (i.e., reduce, reuse, and recycle) and communicate results.
E.K.10.3     Create a product from the reused materials that will meet a human need (e.g., pencil holder,
             musical instrument, bird feeder). Use an engineering design process to define the problem,
             design, construct, evaluate, and improve the product.*

In Grade 1, students build on the language, vocabulary, and mathematical concepts developed in
kindergarten to construct explanations stemming from patterns observed in the natural
environment. Students conduct investigations to determine what plants need to live and grow. They test
predictions, discover patterns in plant and animal life cycles, and construct explanations about plant needs
for growth and survival. Students use an engineering design process to solve the problem of plant
overcrowding in a garden. Students observe plant adaptations, such as trees shedding leaves, or leaves
turning toward the sun, and establish the cause and effect relationship between adaptations and
environmental changes. Students describe, compare, and analyze daily weather data to determine weather
patterns in different seasons. They use an engineering design process to create a system to better plan and
respond to severe weather. Students investigate light and sound to find materials that light passes through
and materials that change sound. They construct a device that uses light and/or sound to communicate
over a distance. Students develop investigations and make predictions about patterns in the natural
world. Acting as scientists, students observe the natural world and use investigations, charts, drawings,
sketches, and models to communicate ideas.

L.1.1 Hierarchical Organization
Conceptual Understanding: All living things reproduce, grow, develop, respond to stimuli, and die. Living
things require air, food, water, and an environment in which to live. Plants are living things, and each plant
part (roots, stem, leaves, and fruit) helps them survive, grow, and reproduce.
L.1.1        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the basic needs and structures of
             plants.
L.1.1.1      Construct explanations using first-hand observations or other media to describe the structures
             of different plants (i.e., root, stem, leaves, flowers, and fruit). Report findings using drawings,
             writing, or models.
L.1.1.2      Obtain information from informational text and other media to describe the function of each
             plant part (roots absorb water and anchor the plant, leaves make food, the stem transports
             water and food, petals attract pollinators, flowers produce seeds, and seeds produce new
             plants).
L.1.1.3      Design and conduct an experiment that shows the absorption of water and how it is transported
             through the plant. Report observations using drawings, sketches, or models.

             flowers, seeds).
L.1.1.5      With teacher support, gain an understanding that scientists are humans who use observations
             and experiments to learn about the natural world. Obtain information from informational text
             or other media about scientists who have made important observations about plants (e.g.,
             Theophrastus, Gregor Mendel, George Washington Carver, Katherine Esau).

L.1.2 Reproduction and Heredity
Conceptual Understanding: Plants and animals change with each stage of life. Plants have predictable and
observable characteristics at each developmental stage (germination, growth, reproduction, and seed
dispersal). Most plants are stationary so they depend upon animals or the wind for seed dispersal. Plants
and animals are similar to their parents and resemble other plants and animals of the same kind.
L.1.2        Students will demonstrate an understanding of how living things change in form as
             they go through the general stages of a life cycle.
L.1.2.1      Investigate, using observations and measurements (non-standard units), flowering plants
             (pumpkins, peas, marigolds, or sunflowers) as they change during the life cycle (i.e.,
             germination, growth, reproduction, and seed dispersal). Use drawings, writing, or models to
             communicate findings.
L.1.2.2      Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information through labeled drawings, the life cycle (egg,
             larva, pupa, adult) of pollinating insects (e.g., bees, butterflies).

L.1.3 Ecology and Interdependence
Conceptual Understanding: The needs of plants must be met to survive. Sunlight, water, nutrients, and
space to grow are necessary for plant growth and repair.
L.1.3A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of what plants need from the
             environment for growth and repair.
L.1.3A.1     Conduct structured investigations to make and test predictions about what plants need to live,
             grow, and repair including water, nutrients, sunlight, and space. Develop explanations, compare
             results, and report findings.
Conceptual Understanding: Animals, such as insects, depend on other living organisms for food. Many
plants depend on insects or other animals for pollination or to move their seeds around so the plant can
survive.
L.1.3B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the interdependence of flowering
             plants and pollinating insects.
L.1.3B.1     Identify the body parts of a pollinating insect (e.g., bee, butterfly) and describe how insects use
             these parts to gather nectar or disburse pollen. Report findings using drawings, writing, or
             models.

L.1.4 Adaptations and Diversity
Conceptual Understanding: Plants respond to stimuli (e.g., turn their leaves to the sun, use tendrils to grab
and support) to adapt to changes in the environment. There are distinct environments in the world that
support certain types of plants. Plants have features that help them survive in their environment.

             environment in order to survive.
L.1.4.1      Explore the cause and effect relationship between plant adaptations and environmental
             changes (i.e., leaves turning toward the sun, leaves changing color, leaves wilting, or trees
             shedding leaves).
L.1.4.2      Describe how the different characteristics of plants help them to survive in distinct environments
             (e.g., rain forest, desert, grasslands, forests).
L.1.4.3      Create a solution for an agricultural problem (i.e. pollination, seed dispersal, over-crowding).
             Use an engineering design process to define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and
             improve the solution.*

P.1.6 Motions, Forces, and Energy
Conceptual Understanding: Some objects allow light to pass through them and some objects do not allow
any light to pass through them, creating shadows. Very hot objects give off light. Objects reflect light, and
objects can only be seen when light is reflected off them. Mirrors and prisms can be used to change the
direction of a light beam
P.1.6A       Students will demonstrate an understanding that light is required to make objects
             visible.
P.1.6A.1     Construct explanations using first-hand observations or other media to describe how reflected
             light makes an object visible.
P.1.6A.2     Use evidence from observations to explain how shadows form and change with the position of
             the light source.
Conceptual Understanding: Vibrations of matter can create sound, and sound can make an object vibrate.
Humans use sound and light to communicate over long distances.
P.1.6B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of sound.
P.1.6B.1     Conduct an investigation to provide evidence that vibrations create sound (e.g., pluck a guitar
             string) and that sound can create vibrations (e.g., feeling sound through a speaker).
P.1.6B.2     Create a device that uses light and/or sound to communicate over a distance (e.g., signal lamp
             with a flashlight). Use an engineering design process to define the problem, design, construct,
             evaluate, and improve the device.*

E.1.9 Earth’s Systems and Cycles
Conceptual Understanding: Weather is a combination of temperature, sunlight, wind, snow, or rain in a
particular place at a particular time. People measure weather conditions (temperature, precipitation) to
describe and record the weather and to notice patterns over time. Temperature and precipitation can
change with the seasons. Some kinds of severe weather (hurricane, tornado, flood, and drought) are more
likely to occur in certain regions. Meteorologists forecast severe weather so that communities can prepare
for and respond appropriately.

E.1.9A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the patterns of weather by
             describing, recording, and analyzing weather data to answer questions about daily
             and seasonal weather patterns.
E.1.9A.1     Analyze and interpret data from observations and measurements to describe local weather
             conditions (including temperature, wind, and forms of precipitation).
E.1.9A.2     Develop and use models to predict weather conditions associated with seasonal patterns and
             changes.
E.1.9A.3     Construct an explanation for the general pattern of change in daily temperatures by measuring
             and calculating the difference between morning and afternoon temperatures.
E.1.9A.4     Obtain and communicate information about severe weather conditions to explain why certain
             safety precautions are necessary.
Conceptual Understanding: The Earth is made of different materials, including rocks, soil, and water
(nonliving things). Plants and animals, including humans, depend on the Earth’s land, water, and air to live
and grow. Animals, including humans, can change the environment (e.g., shape of the land, the flow of
water).
E.1.9B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of models (drawings or maps) to
             describe how water and land are distributed on Earth.
E.1.9B.1     Locate, classify, and describe bodies of water (oceans, rivers, lakes, and ponds) on the Earth’s
             surface using maps, globes, or other media.
E.1.9B.2     Generate and answer questions to explain the patterns and location of frozen and liquid bodies
             of water on earth using maps, globes, or other media.

             movement of water can change the shape of the land on earth.
                            GRADE ONE: Earth and Space Science
E.1.10 Earth’s Resources
Conceptual Understanding: Water is essential to life on earth. Humans and other living things are
dependent on clean water to survive. Water is an Earth material, and like all of Earth’s resources, the
amount of water is limited. Continued health and survival of humans are dependent on solutions that
maintain clean water sources.
E.1.10       Students will demonstrate an understanding of human dependence on clean and
             renewable water resources.
E.1.10.1     Obtain and evaluate informational texts and other media to generate and answer questions
             about water sources and human uses of clean water.
E.1.10.2     Communicate solutions that will reduce the impact of humans on the use and quality of water in
             the local environment.
E.1.10.3     Create a device that will collect free water to meet a human need (e.g., household drinking
             water, watering plants/animals, cleaning). Use an engineering design process to define the
             problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the device.*

                                  Theme: Systems, Order, and Organization
In Grade 2, students organize plants and animals according to their physical characteristics and recognize
that living things are part of a larger system. Students construct models showing the characteristics of
animals that help them survive in their environments, and construct scientific arguments explaining how
animals can make major and minor changes in the environment. Students conduct investigations to find
and report evidence where plants and animals compete or cooperate with other plants in a system before
identifying the adaptations that help them survive in that environment. Students investigate the
relationship between friction and the motion of an object by changing the strength, direction, and speed of
pushes and pulls. Students use an engineering design process to construct a ramp that will reduce or
increase friction to solve a problem, such as rolling a baby carriage safely down a steep ramp.
                                         GRADE TWO: Life Science

to survive in their environment. Animals can be classified based on physical characteristics.
L.2.1         Students will demonstrate an understanding of the classification of animals based on
              physical characteristics.
L.2.1.1       Compare and sort groups of animals with backbones (vertebrates) from groups of animals
              without backbones (invertebrates).
L.2.1.2       Classify vertebrates (mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and reptiles) based on their physical
              characteristics.
L.2.1.3       Compare and contrast physical characteristics that distinguish classes of vertebrates (i.e.,
              reptiles compared to amphibians).
L.2.1.4       Construct a scientific argument for classifying vertebrates that have unusual characteristics,
              such as bats, penguins, snakes, salamanders, dolphins, and duck-billed platypuses (i.e., bats
              have wings yet they are mammals).

L.2.3 Ecology and Interdependence
Conceptual Understanding: Animals thrive in environments where their needs (air, water, food, and
shelter) are met. The environment where plants and animals live sometimes changes slowly and sometimes
changes rapidly. If living things are unable to adapt to changes in the environment, they may not survive.
L.2.3A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the interdependence of living things
             and the environment in which they live.
L.2.3A.1     Evaluate and communicate findings from informational text or other media to describe how
             animals change and respond to rapid or slow changes in their environment (fire, pollution,
             changes in tide, availability of food/water).
L.2.3A.2     Construct scientific arguments to explain how animals can make major changes (e.g., beaver
             dams obstruct streams, or large deer populations destroying crops) and minor changes to their
             environments (e.g., ant hills, crawfish burrows, mole tunnels). Communicate findings.
Conceptual Understanding: All animals and plants need food to provide energy for activity and raw
materials for growth Animals and plants have physical features and behaviors that help them survive in
their environment. All living things in an environment interact with each other in different ways and for
different reasons.
L.2.3B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the interdependence of living things.
L.2.3B.1     Evaluate and communicate findings from informational text or other media to describe and to
             compare how animals interact with other animals and plants in the environment (i.e., predator-
             prey relationships, herbivore, carnivore, omnivore).
L.2.3B.2     Conduct an investigation to find evidence where plants and animals compete or cooperate with
             other plants and animals for food or space. Present findings (i.e., using technology or models).
                                      GRADE TWO: Life Science
L.2.4 Adaptations and Diversity
Conceptual Understanding: Living things need air, food, water, and space to survive. Different
environments support different types of plants and animals. Animals have adaptations allowing them to
grow and survive in the climate of their specific environment.
L.2.4        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the ways animals adapt to their
             environment in order to survive.
L.2.4.1      Evaluate and communicate findings from informational text or other media to describe how
             plants and animals use adaptations to survive (e.g., ducks use webbed feet to swim in lakes and
             ponds, cacti have waxy coatings and spines to grow in the desert) in distinct environments (e.g.,
             polar lands, saltwater and freshwater, desert, rainforest, woodlands).
L.2.4.2      Create a solution exemplified by animal adaptations to solve a human problem in a specific
             environment (e.g., snowshoes are like hare’s feet or flippers are like duck's feet). Use an
             engineering design process to define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the
             solution.*

P.2.5 Organization of Matter and Chemical Interactions
Conceptual Understanding: Matter exists in different states, including solid, liquid, and gas forms. Solids
have a definite shape, weight, and size (length). Liquids have a definite size (volume) but not a definite
shape. A gas has neither definite shape nor size (volume). Changes to matter can result from changes in
temperature. Some changes may or may not be reversible (i.e., melting or freezing versus burning a cake).
P.2.5        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the properties of matter.
P.2.5.1      Conduct a structured investigation to collect, represent, and analyze categorical data to classify
             matter as solid, liquid, or gas. Report findings and describe a variety of materials according to
             observable physical properties (e.g., size, color, texture, opacity, solubility).
P.2.5.2      Compare and measure the length of solid objects using technology and mathematical
             representations. Analyze and communicate findings.
P.2.5.3      Compare the weight of solid objects and the volume of liquid objects. Analyze and communicate
             findings.
P.2.5.4      Construct scientific arguments to support claims that some changes to matter caused by
             heating can be reversed, and some changes cannot be reversed.
                                   GRADE TWO: Physical Science
P.2.6 Motions, Forces, and Energy
Conceptual Understanding: An object at rest will stay at rest unless it is pushed or pulled by an unbalanced
force. Pushes and pulls can have different strengths, directions, or speeds. Friction occurs when two objects
make contact. Friction can change the motion of an object, the speed of an object, and can also create
heat. Friction can be increased or decreased.
P.2.6        Students will demonstrate an understanding of how the motion of objects is affected
             by pushes, pulls, and friction on an object.
P.2.6.1      Conduct a structured investigation to collect, represent, and analyze data from observations
             and measurements to demonstrate the effects of pushes and pulls with different strengths and
             directions. Communicate findings (e.g., models or technology).
P.2.6.2      Generate and answer questions about the relationship between (1) friction and the motion of
             objects and (2) friction and the production of heat.
P.2.6.3      Develop a plan to change the force (push or pull) of friction to solve a human problem (e.g.,
             improve the ride on a playground slide or make a toy car or truck go faster). Use an engineering
             design process to define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the plan.*

E.2.8 Earth and the Universe
Conceptual Understanding: Patterns of the Sun, Moon, and stars can be observed, described, and
predicted. The sun is the source of heat and light for the solar system. Seasonal changes occur as the Earth
orbits the Sun because of the tilt of the Earth on its axis. At night, one can see light from stars and sunlight
being reflected from the moon. Telescopes make it possible to observe the Moon and the planets in greater
detail. Space exploration continues to help humans understand more about the universe.

            and experiments to learn about space. Obtain information from informational text or other
            media about scientists who have made important discoveries about objects in space (e.g.,
            Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, George Ellery Hale, Jill Tarter) or the development of
            technologies (e.g., various telescopes and detection devices, computer modeling, and space
            exploration).
E.2.8.5     Use informational text and other media to observe, describe and predict the visual patterns of
            motion of the Sun (sunrise, sunset) and Moon (phases).
E.2.8.6     Create a model that will demonstrate the observable pattern of motion of the Sun or Moon. Use
            an engineering design process to define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve
            the model.*
                           GRADE TWO: Earth and Space Science
E.2.10 Earth’s Resources
Conceptual Understanding: Earth is made of different materials, including rocks, sand, soil, and water. An
Earth material is a resource that comes from Earth. Earth materials can be classified by their observable
properties. Human life and health are heavily dependent on these materials. Understanding how to best
conserve these resources will continue to be a major challenge for humans.
E.2.10      Students will demonstrate an understanding of how humans use Earth’s resources.
E.2.10.1    Use informational text, other media, and first-hand observations to investigate, analyze and
            compare the properties of Earth materials (including rocks, soils, sand, and water).
E.2.10.2    Conduct an investigation to identify and classify everyday objects that are resources from the
            Earth (e.g., drinking water, granite countertops, clay dishes, wood furniture, or gas grill).
            Classify these objects as renewable and nonrenewable resources.
E.2.10.3    Use informational text and other media to summarize and communicate how Earth materials
            are used (e.g., soil and water to grow plants; rocks to make roads, walls or building; or sand to
            make glass).
E.2.10.4    Use informational text, other media, and first-hand observations to investigate and

through Grade 2 to begin planning their own investigations to answer scientific questions. Because science
foundations created at this level are key in developing students for college and career readiness, the
cultivation of opportunities for inquiry-based activities and experiences that emphasize the problem solving
and the engineering design process is critical.
The standards for Grades 3-5 have been developed around the following crosscutting concepts or themes:
          ● Grade 3 – Interactions Within an Environment
          ● Grade 4 – Energy and Change
          ● Grade 5 – Interdependence of Systems
In Grade 3, students are expected to engage in the engineering design process and conduct research and
communicate their understanding of each standard in a variety of ways. In Grade 4, students will observe,
research, and conduct investigations to discover patterns related to energy and change in the world around
them. In Grade 5, students will model, provide evidence to support arguments, and obtain and display data
about relationships among a variety of systems. Because of this yearlong study, students will gain content
knowledge and tools to provide evidence and support arguments about the ways systems across content
areas are interconnected and interdependent.
The core science content utilizes hands-on classroom instruction to reinforce the seven crosscutting
concepts (i.e., patterns; cause and effect; scale, portion, and quantity; systems and system models; energy
and matter; structure and function; and stability and change.
SEPs are in life science, physical science, and Earth and space science. The SEPs are designed so that
students may develop skills and apply knowledge to solve real-life problems. While presented as distinct
skill sets, the eight practices intentionally overlap and interconnect as students explore the science
concepts. Some examples of specific skills students should develop in Grades 3-5 are listed below.
     1. Ask questions to predict how natural or man-made changes in a habitat cause plants and animals to
          respond in different ways, including hibernating, migrating, responding to light, death, or extinction
          (e.g., sea turtles, the dodo bird, or nocturnal species).
     2. Develop and use models to explain the unique and diverse life cycles of organisms other than
          humans (e.g., flowering plants, frogs, or butterflies) including commonalities (e.g., birth, growth,
          reproduction, or death).
     3. Plan and conduct scientific investigations to classify different materials as either an insulator or
          conductor of electricity.
     4. Analyze and interpret data to describe and predict how natural processes (e.g., weathering,
          erosion, deposition, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or storms) affect Earth’s surface.
     5. Collect, analyze, and interpret data from measurements of the physical properties of solids, liquids,
          and gases (e.g., volume, shape, movement, and spacing of particles).
     6. Construct explanations about regional climate differences using maps and long-term data from
          various regions.
     7. Construct scientific arguments to support claims about the importance of astronomy in navigation
          and exploration, including the use of telescopes, compasses, and star charts.

           MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                            2018
    8. Obtain and evaluate scientific information regarding the characteristics of different ecosystems and
         the organisms they support (e.g., salt and fresh water, deserts, grasslands, forests, rain forests, or
         polar tundra lands).
Curricula and instructions that integrate science and engineering practices should reflect the skills outlined
above.
The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a step-by-step method of devising a system, component, or process
to meet desired needs. This is similar to the “scientific method” which is taught to young scientists.
However, the EDP is a flexible process. Students can begin at any step, focus on just one step, move back
and forth between steps, or repeat the cycle. Engineering standards are represented in some performance
objectives with grade-banded, specific wording that will prompt students to approach learning and
exploration using the engineering process. These performance objectives are marked with an * at the end
of the statement. Professional development and teacher resources will be developed for teachers as EDP is
incorporated into Mississippi standards.
Each standard in Grades 3, 4, and 5 allows students to be active doers of science rather than passive
observers of science. This approach creates an opportunity for student learning and engages the pupil in
the scientific investigation process. Therefore, students need to be supplied with the appropriate resources
and materials to complete scientific investigations.

                                                GRADE THREE
                               Theme: Interactions within an Environment
In Grade 3, students will increase their use of science and engineering practices for obtaining, recording,
charting, and analyzing data in the study of a variety of environments. The crosscutting concept can be seen
in life science through an organism’s ability to grow, develop, survive, obtain food/energy, and reproduce
within a given environment. In physical science, the concept is developed through a study of matter and its
properties and their interactions based on environmental changes and surroundings. The study of Earth
science in third grade investigates surface features affected by one or more of Earth’s spheres and human
impacts on the environment. Students are expected to engage in the engineering design process and
conduct research and communicate their understanding of each standard in a variety of ways. Because of
this yearlong study, students will gain content knowledge and tools to provide evidence and support
arguments about the ways matter and organisms interact and are affected by the environment.
                                      GRADE THREE: Life Science
L.3.1 Hierarchical Organization
Conceptual Understanding: Plants and animals have physical characteristics and features that allow them
to receive information from the environment. Structural adaptations within groups of plants and animals
allow them to better survive and reproduce in an environment.
L.3.1         Students will demonstrate an understanding of internal and external structures in
              plants and animals and how they relate to their growth, survival, behavior, and
              reproduction within an environment.
L.3.1.1       Examine evidence to communicate information that the internal and external structures of
              animals (e.g., heart, stomach, bone, lung, brain, skin, ears, appendages) function to support
              survival, growth, and behavior.
L.3.1.2       Examine evidence to communicate information that the internal and external structures of plant
              (e.g., thorns, leaves, stems, roots, or colored petals) function to support survival, growth,
              behavior, and reproduction.
L.3.1.3       Obtain and communicate examples of physical features or behaviors of vertebrates and
              invertebrates and how these characteristics help them survive in particular environments, (e.g.,
              animals hibernate, migrate, or estivate to stay alive when food is scarce or temperatures are
              not favorable).
                                      GRADE THREE: Life Science
L.3.2 Reproduction and Heredity
Conceptual Understanding: Scientists have identified and classified many types of plants and animals.
Some characteristics and traits that organisms have are inherited, and some result from interactions with
the environment.
L.3.2         Students will demonstrate an understanding that through reproduction, the survival
              and physical features of plants and animals are inherited traits from parent organisms
              but can also be influenced by the environment.
        34   Grade Three Science


          MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                               2018
L.3.2.1      Identify traits and describe how traits are passed from parent organism(s) to offspring in plants
             and animals.
L.3.2.2      Describe and provide examples of plant and animal offspring from a single parent organism
             (e.g., bamboo, fern, or starfish) as being an exact replica with identical traits as the parent
             organism.
L.3.2.3      Describe and provide examples of offspring from two parent organisms as containing a
             combination of inherited traits from both parent organisms.
L.3.2.4      Obtain and communicate data to provide evidence that plants and animals have traits inherited
             from both parent organisms and that variations of these traits exist in groups of similar
             organisms (e.g., flower colors in pea plants or fur color and pattern in animal offspring).
L.3.2.5      Research to justify the concept that traits can be influenced by the environment (e.g., stunted
             growth in normally tall plants due to insufficient water, changes in an arctic fox’s fur color due
             to light and/or temperature, or flamingo plumage).
                                      GRADE THREE: Life Science
L.3.4 Adaptations and Diversity
Conceptual Understanding: When the environment or habitat changes, some plants and animals survive
and reproduce, some move to new locations, and some die. Scientists can obtain historical information
from fossils to provide evidence of both the organism and environments in which they lived.
L.3.4        Students will demonstrate an understanding of how adaptations allow animals to
             satisfy life needs and respond both physically and behaviorally to their environment.
L.3.4.1      Obtain data from informational text to explain how changes in habitats (both those that occur
             naturally and those caused by organisms) can be beneficial or harmful to the organisms that
             live there.
L.3.4.2      Ask questions to predict how natural or man-made changes in a habitat cause plants and
             animals to respond in different ways, including hibernating, migrating, responding to light,
             death, or extinction (e.g., sea turtles, the dodo bird, or nocturnal species).
L.3.4.3      Analyze and interpret data to explain how variations in characteristics among organisms of the
             same species may provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing (e.g., plants
             with larger thorns being less likely to be eaten by predators or animals with better camouflage
             colorations being more likely to survive and bear offspring).
L.3.4.4      Define and improve a solution to a problem created by environmental changes and any
             resulting impacts on the types of density and distribution of plant and animal populations living
             in the environment (e.g., replanting sea oats in coastal areas or developing or preserving
             wildlife corridors and green belts). Use an engineering design process to define the problem,
             design, construct, evaluate, and improve the environment.*
L.3.4.5      Construct scientific argument using evidence from fossils of plants and animals that lived long
             ago to infer the characteristics of early environments (e.g., marine fossils on dry land, tropical
             plant fossils in arctic areas, or fossils of extinct organisms in any environment).
                                  GRADE THREE: Physical Science
P.3.5 Organization of Matter and Chemical Interactions
Conceptual Understanding: Matter is made up of particles that are too small to be seen. Even though the
particles are very small, the movement and spacing of these particles determine the basic properties of
matter. Matter exists in several different states and is classified based on observable and measurable
      35    Grade Three Science


          MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                             2018
properties. Matter can be changed from one state to another when heat (i.e., thermal energy) is added or
removed.
P.3.5         Students will demonstrate an understanding of the physical properties of matter to
              explain why matter can change states between a solid, liquid, or gas dependent upon
              the addition or removal of heat.
P.3.5.1       Plan and conduct scientific investigations to determine how changes in heat (i.e., an increase or
              decrease) change matter from one state to another (e.g., melting, freezing, condensing, boiling,
              or evaporating).
P.3.5.2       Develop and use models to communicate the concept that matter is made of particles too small
              to be seen that move freely around in space (e.g., inflation and shape of a balloon, wind blowing
              leaves, or dust suspended in the air).
P.3.5.3       Plan and conduct investigations that particles speed up or slow down with addition or removal
              of heat.
                                   GRADE THREE: Physical Science
P.3.6 Motions, Forces, and Energy
Conceptual Understanding: Magnets are a specific type of solid that can attract and repel certain other
kinds of materials, including other magnets. There are some materials that are neither attracted to nor
repelled by magnets. Because of their special properties, magnets are used in various ways. Magnets can
exert forces—a push or a pull—on other magnets or magnetic materials, causing energy transfer between
them, even when the objects are not touching.
P.3.6         Students will demonstrate an understanding of magnets and the effects of pushes,
              pulls, and friction on the motion of objects.
P.3.6.1       Compare and contrast the effects of different strengths and directions of forces on the motion
              of an object (e.g., gravity, polarity, attraction, repulsion, or strength).
P.3.6.2       Plan an experiment to investigate the relationship between a force applied to an object (e.g.,
              friction, gravity) and resulting motion of the object.
P.3.6.3       Research and communicate information to explain how magnets are used in everyday life.
P.3.6.4       Define and solve a simple design problem by applying scientific ideas about magnets (e.g., can
              opener, door latches, paperclip holders, finding studs in walls, magnetized paint). Use an
              engineering design process to define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the
              magnet.*
                            GRADE THREE: Earth and Space Science
E.3.7 Earth’s Structure and History
Conceptual Understanding: Since its formation, the Earth has undergone a great deal of geological change
driven by its composition and systems. Scientists use many methods to learn more about the history and
age of Earth. Earth materials include rocks, soils, water, and gases. Rock is composed of different
combinations of minerals. Smaller rocks come from the breakage and weathering of bedrock and larger
rocks. Soil is made partly from weathered rock, partly from plant remains, and contains many living
organisms.

           MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                            2018
E.3.7A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the various processes involved in the
             rock cycle, superposition of rock layers, and fossil formation.
E.3.7A.1     Plan and conduct controlled scientific investigations to identify the processes involved in
             forming the three major types of rock, and investigate common techniques used to identify
             them.
E.3.7A.2     Develop and use models to demonstrate the processes involved in the development of various
             rock formations, including superposition, and how those formations can fracture and move over
             time.
E.3.7A.3     Ask questions to generate testable hypotheses regarding the formation and location of fossil
             types, including their presence in some sedimentary rock.
Conceptual Understanding: Earth has an active mantle, which interacts with the Earth’s crust to drive plate
tectonics and form new rocks. Resulting surface features change through interactions with water, air, and
living things. Waves, wind, water, and ice shape and reshape the Earth’s land surface by eroding rock and
soil in some areas and depositing them in other areas. Scientists use many methods to learn more about
the history and age of Earth.
E.3.7B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the composition of Earth and the
             processes which change Earth’s landforms.
E.3.7B.1     Obtain and evaluate scientific information (e.g. using technology) to describe the four major
             layers of Earth and the varying compositions of each layer.
E.3.7B.2     Develop and use models to describe the characteristics of Earth's continental landforms and
             classify landforms as volcanoes, mountains, valleys, canyons, planes, and islands.
E.3.7B.3     Develop and use models of weathering, erosion, and deposition processes which explain the
             appearance of various Earth features (e.g., the Grand Canyon, Arches National Park in Utah,
             Plymouth Bluff in Columbus, or Red Bluff in Marion County, Mississippi).
E.3.7B.4     Compare and contrast constructive (e.g., deposition, volcano) and destructive (e.g., weathering,
             erosion, earthquake) processes of the Earth.
                           GRADE THREE: Earth and Space Science
E.3.9 Earth’s Systems and Cycles
Conceptual Understanding: The Earth’s land can be situated above or submerged below water. Water in
the atmosphere changes states according to energy levels driven by the sun and its interactions with
various Earth components, both living and non-living. The downhill movement of water as it flows to the
ocean shapes the appearance of the land.
E.3.9        Students will demonstrate an understanding of how the Earth’s systems (i.e.,
             geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere) interact in multiple ways to
             affect Earth's surface materials and processes.
E.3.9.1      Develop models to communicate the characteristics of the Earth's major systems, including the
             geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere (e.g., digital models, illustrations, flip
             books, diagrams, charts, tables).
E.3.9.2      Construct explanations of how different landforms and surface features result from the location
             and movement of water on Earth’s surface (e.g., watersheds, drainage basins, deltas, or rivers).
       37   Grade Three Science


          MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                             2018
E.3.9.3      Use graphical representations to communicate the distribution of freshwater and saltwater on
             Earth (e.g., oceans, lakes, rivers, glaciers, groundwater, or polar ice caps).
                            GRADE THREE: Earth and Space Science
E.3.10 Earth’s Resources
Conceptual Understanding: Earth is made of materials that provide resources for human activities, and
their use affects the environment in multiple ways. Some resources are renewable and others are not.
E.3.10       Students will demonstrate an understanding that all materials, energy, and fuels that
             humans use are derived from natural sources.
E.3.10.1     Identify some of Earth's resources that are used in everyday life such as water, wind, soil,
             forests, oil, natural gas, and minerals and classify as renewable or nonrenewable.
E.3.10.2     Obtain and communicate information to exemplify how humans attain, use, and protect
             renewable and nonrenewable Earth resources.
E.3.10.3     Use maps and historical information to identify natural resources in the state connecting
             (a) how resources are used for human needs and (b) how the use of those resources impacts the
             environment.
E.3.10.4     Design a process for cleaning a polluted environment (e.g., simulating an oil spill in the ocean or
             a flood in a city and creating a solution for containment and/or cleanup). Use an engineering
             design process to define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the
             environment.*

In Grade 4, students will observe, research, and conduct investigations to discover patterns related to
energy and change in the world around them. The crosscutting concept can be seen in life science through
the study of human body systems, including their functions, interactions, and reliance upon other systems
within the body. In physical science, the concept is developed through a study of energy in the forms of
heat, light, sound, and electricity, as well as the conservation and transfer of energy from one form to
another. The study of Earth science in fourth grade investigates the driving force of energy as it relates to
the water cycle and changes in patterns of weather and climate. Students are expected to engage in
engineering design practices, conduct research, and communicate their understanding of each standard in
a variety of ways. Because of this yearlong study, students will gain research and process skills to build
content knowledge that will support arguments about the ways energy and change relate to the world
around us.
                                      GRADE FOUR: Life Science
L.4.1 Hierarchical Organization
Conceptual Understanding: All organisms need energy for growth and development. Animals have
specialized structures and systems for obtaining and processing energy. These structures and systems
cannot function properly without adequate nourishment. Living organisms can be adversely affected by
environmental conditions or disease.
L.4.1         Students will demonstrate an understanding of the organization, functions, and
              interconnections of the major human body systems.
L.4.1.1       Use technology or other resources to research and discover general system function (e.g.,
              machines, water cycle) as they relate to human organ systems and identify organs that work
              together to create organ systems.
L 4.1.2       Obtain and communicate data to describe patterns that indicate the nature of relationships
              between human organ systems, which interact with one another to control digestion,
              respiration, circulation, excretion, movement, coordination, and protection from infection.
L.4.1.3       Construct models of organ systems (e.g. circulatory, digestive, respiratory, muscular, skeletal,
              nervous) to demonstrate both the unique function of the system and how multiple organs and
              organ systems work together to accomplish more complex functions.
L.4.1.4       Research and communicate how noninfectious diseases (e.g. diabetes, heart disease) and
              infectious diseases (e.g. cold, flu) serve to disrupt the function of the body system.
L.4.1.5       Using informational text, investigate how scientific fields, medical specialties, and research
              methods help us find new ways to maintain a healthy body and lifestyle (e.g. diet, exercise,
              vaccines, and mental health).

L.4.2 Reproduction and Heredity
Conceptual Understanding: Scientists have identified and classified many types of plants and animals. Each
plant or animal has a unique pattern of growth and development called a life cycle. All of Earth’s cycles are
driven by energy which can be traced back to the sun.

L.4.2         Students will demonstrate an understanding of life cycles, including familiar plants
              and animals (e.g., reptiles, amphibians, or birds).
L.4.2.1       Compare and contrast life cycles of familiar plants and animals.
L.4.2.2       Develop and use models to explain the unique and diverse life cycles of organisms other than
              humans (e.g., flowering plants, frogs, or butterflies) including commonalities (e.g., birth,
              growth, reproduction, or death).
                                    GRADE FOUR: Physical Science
P.4.6 Motions, Forces, and Energy
Conceptual Understanding: As different forms of energy, heat and electricity can be produced in different
ways and are transferred and conducted from one form or object to another. Some materials can be
conductors or insulators of heat energy. Electricity can be transferred from place to place by electric
currents to produce motion, sound, heat, or light.
P.4.6A        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the common sources and uses of heat
              and electric energy and the materials used to transfer heat and electricity.
P.4.6A.1      Obtain and communicate information to compare how different processes (including burning,
              friction, and electricity) serve as sources of heat energy.
P.4.6A.2      Plan and conduct scientific investigations to classify different materials as either an insulator or
              conductor of electricity.
P.4.6A.3      Develop models demonstrating how heat and electrical energy can be transformed into other
              forms of energy (e.g., motion, sound, heat, or light).
P.4.6A.4      Develop models that demonstrate the path of an electric current in a complete, simple circuit
              (e.g., lighting a light bulb or making a sound).
P.4.6A.5      Use informational text and technology resources to communicate technological breakthroughs
              made by historical figures in electricity (e.g. Alessandro Volta, Michael Faraday, Nicola Tesla,
              Thomas Edison, incandescent light bulbs, batteries, Light Emitting Diodes).
P.4.6A.6      Design a device that converts any form of energy from one form to another form (e.g., construct
              a musical instrument that will convert vibrations to sound by controlling varying pitches, a solar
              oven that will convert energy from the sun to heat energy, or a simple circuit that can be used to
              complete a task). Use an engineering design process to define the problem, design, construct,
              evaluate, and improve the device.*
Conceptual Understanding: Light, as a form of energy, has specific properties, including brightness. Light
travels in a straight line until it strikes an object. The way light behaves when it strikes an object depends on
the object's properties.
P.4.6B        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the properties of light as forms of
              energy.
P.4.6B.1      Construct scientific evidence to support the claim that white light is made up of different colors.
              Include the work of Sir Isaac Newton to communicate results.
P.4.6B.2      Obtain and communicate information to explain how the visibility of an object is related to light.
P.4.6B.3      Develop and use models to communicate how light travels and behaves when it strikes an
              object, including reflection, refraction, and absorption.

P.4.6B.4     Plan and conduct scientific investigations to explain how light behaves when it strikes
             transparent, translucent, and opaque materials.
Conceptual Understanding: Sound, as a form of energy, is produced by vibrating objects (matter) and has
specific properties, including pitch and volume. Sound travels through air and other materials and is used to
communicate information in various forms of technology.
P.4.6C       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the properties of sound as a form of
             energy.
P.4.6C.1     Plan and conduct scientific investigations to test how different variables affect the properties of
             sound (i.e., pitch and volume).
P.4.6C.2     In relation to how sound is perceived by humans, analyze and interpret data from observations
             and measurements to report how changes in vibration affect the pitch and volume of sound.
P.4.6C.3     Obtain and communicate information about scientists who pioneered in the science of sound,
             (e.g., Alexander Graham Bell, Robert Boyle, Daniel Bernoulli, and Guglielmo Marconi).
                            GRADE FOUR: Earth and Space Science
E.4.9 Earth’s Systems and Cycles
Conceptual Understanding: Earth’s atmosphere is a mixture of gases, including water vapor and oxygen.
Water, which is found almost everywhere on Earth, including the atmosphere, changes form and cycles
between Earth’s surface to the air and back again. This cycling of water is driven by energy from the sun.
The movement of water in the water cycle is a major process that influences weather conditions. Clouds
form during this cycle and various types of precipitation result.
E.4.9A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of how the water cycle is propelled by
             the sun’s energy.
E.4.9A.1     Develop and use models to explain how the sun’s energy drives the water cycle. (e.g.,
             evaporation, condensation, precipitation, transpiration, runoff, and groundwater).
Conceptual Understanding: Scientists record patterns in weather conditions over time and across the globe
to make predictions about what kind of weather might occur next. Climate describes the range of an area’s
typical weather conditions and the extent to which those conditions vary over long periods of time.
E.4.9B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of weather and climate patterns.
E.4.9B.1     Analyze and interpret data (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind speed/direction, relative
             humidity, or cloud types) to predict changes in weather over time.
E.4.9B.2     Construct explanations about regional climate differences using maps and long-term data from
             various regions.
E.4.9B.3     Design weather instruments utilized to measure weather conditions (e.g., barometer,
             hygrometer, rain gauge, anemometer, or wind vane). Use an engineering design process to
             define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the weather instrument.*

         MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                             2018
Conceptual Understanding: Earth’s oceans and landforms can be affected in various ways by natural
processes in one or more of Earth’s spheres (i.e., atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere).
Humans cannot eliminate natural hazards caused by these processes but can take steps to reduce their
impacts. Human activities can affect the land and oceans in positive and negative ways.
E.4.9C      Students will demonstrate an understanding of how natural processes and human
            activities affect the features of Earth’s landforms and oceans.
E.4.9C.1    Analyze and interpret data to describe and predict how natural processes (e.g., weathering,
            erosion, deposition, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or storms) affect Earth’s surface.
E.4.9C.2    Develop and use models of natural processes to explain the effect of the movement of water on
            the ocean shore zone, including beaches, barrier islands, estuaries, and inlets (e.g., marshes,
            bays, lagoons, fjord, or sound).
E.4.9C.3    Construct scientific arguments from evidence to support claims that human activities, such as
            conservation efforts or pollution, affect the land, oceans, and atmosphere of Earth.
E.4.9C.4    Research and explain how systems (i.e., the atmosphere, geosphere, and/or hydrosphere),
            interact and support life in the biosphere.
E.4.9C.5    Obtain and communicate information about severe weather phenomena (e.g., thunderstorms,
            hurricanes, or tornadoes) to explain steps humans can take to reduce the impact of severe
            weather events.
                          GRADE FOUR: Earth and Space Science
E.4.10 Earth’s Resources
Conceptual Understanding: Energy and fuels are derived from natural sources and human use of these
materials affects the environment in multiple ways. Due to limited natural resources, humans are exploring
the use of abundant solar, water, wind, and geothermal energy resources to develop innovative, high-tech
renewable energy systems.
E.4.10      Students will demonstrate an understanding of the various sources of energy used for
            human needs along with their effectiveness and possible impacts.
E.4.10.1    Organize simple data sets to compare energy and pollution output of various traditional, non-
            renewable resources (e.g. coal, crude oil, wood).
E.4.10.2    Use technology or informational text to investigate, evaluate, and communicate various forms
            of clean energy generation.
      42   Grade Four Science

                                    Theme: Interdependence of Systems
In Grade 5, students will model processes, provide evidence to support arguments, and obtain and display
data about relationships among a variety of systems. The crosscutting concept can be seen in life science
through the transfer of energy from the sun into all parts of a food web and ecosystem. In physical science,
the concept is developed through a study of matter and an examination of forces and motion through the
lens of gravity’s effect on an object. The study of Earth and space science in fifth grade investigates the
Earth in the universe, relationships between the bodies of our solar system, and human interaction with the
Earth. Students are expected to engage in the engineering design process and conduct research to
communicate their understanding of each standard in a variety of ways, including ELA connections to
speaking and writing and mathematics connections to measurements using the metric system. Because of
this yearlong study, students will gain content knowledge and tools to provide evidence and support
arguments about the ways systems across content areas are interconnected and interdependent.
                                        GRADE FIVE: Life Science
L.5.3 Ecology and Interdependence
Conceptual Understanding: All organisms need energy to live and grow. Energy is obtained from the sun.
Cells transform the energy that organisms need to perform essential life functions through a complex
sequence of reactions in which chemical energy is transferred from one system of interacting molecules to
another.
L.5.3A        Students will demonstrate an understanding of photosynthesis and the transfer of
              energy from the sun into chemical energy necessary for plant growth and survival.
L.5.3A.1      Research and communicate the basic process of photosynthesis that is used by plants to convert
              light energy into chemical energy that can be stored and released to fuel an organism’s
              activities.
L.5.3A.2      Analyze environments that do not receive direct sunlight and devise explanations as to how
              photosynthesis occurs, either naturally or artificially.
Conceptual Understanding: A major role an organism serves in an ecosystem can be described by the way
in which it obtains its energy. Energy is transferred within an ecosystem by producers, consumers, or
decomposers. A healthy ecosystem is one in which a diverse population of life forms can meet their needs
in a relatively stable web of life.
L.5.3B        Students will demonstrate an understanding of a healthy ecosystem with a stable
              web of life and the roles of living things within a food chain and/or food web,
              including producers, primary and secondary consumers, and decomposers.
L.5.3B.1      Obtain and evaluate scientific information regarding the characteristics of different ecosystems
              and the organisms they support (e.g., salt and fresh water, deserts, grasslands, forests, rain
              forests, or polar tundra lands).
L.5.3B.2      Develop and use a food chain model to classify organisms as producers, consumers, or
              decomposers. Trace the energy flow to explain how each group of organisms obtains energy.
L.5.3B.3      Design and interpret models of food webs to justify what effects the removal or the addition of
              a species (i.e., introduced or invasive) would have on a specific population and/or the ecosystem
              as a whole.

          MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                               2018
L.5.3B.4     Communicate scientific or technical information that explains human positions in food webs and
             our potential impacts on these systems.
                                  GRADE FIVE: Physical Science
P.5.5 Organization of Matter and Chemical Interactions
Conceptual Understanding: Matter can be segregated into tiny particles that are too small to see, but can
be detected by other methods. These tiny particles are referred to as atoms, which can be combined to
form molecules. Substances exhibit specific properties that can be observed and measured.
P.5.5A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the physical properties of matter.
P.5.5A.1     Obtain and evaluate scientific information to describe basic physical properties of atoms and
             molecules.
P.5.5A.2     Collect, analyze, and interpret data from measurements of the physical properties of solids,
             liquids, and gases (e.g., volume, shape, movement, and spacing of particles).
P.5.5A.3     Analyze matter through observations and measurements to classify materials (e.g., powders,
             metals, minerals, or liquids) based on their properties (e.g., color, hardness, reflectivity,
             electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, response to magnetic forces, solubility, or density).
P.5.5A.4     Make and test predictions about how the density of an object affects whether the object sinks
             or floats when placed in a liquid.
P.5.5A.5     Design a vessel that can safely transport a dense substance (e.g., syrup, coins, marbles) through
             water at various distances and under variable conditions. Use an engineering design process to
             define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the vessel.*
Conceptual Understanding: Substances of the same type can be classified by their similar, observable
properties. Substances can be combined in a variety of ways. A mixture is formed when two or more kinds
of matter are physically combined. Solutions are a special type of mixture in which one substance is
distributed evenly into another substance. When the physical properties of the components in a mixture
are not changed, they can be separated in different physical ways.
P.5.5B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of mixtures and solutions.
P.5.5B.1      Obtain and evaluate scientific information to describe what happens to the properties of
             substances in mixtures and solutions.
P.5.5B.2     Analyze and interpret data to communicate that the concentration of a solution is determined
             by the relative amount of solute versus solvent in various mixtures.
P.5.5B.3     Investigate how different variables (e.g., temperature change, stirring, particle size, or surface
             area) affect the rate at which a solute will dissolve.
P.5.5B.4     Design an effective system (e.g., sifting, filtration, evaporation, magnetic attraction, or
             floatation) for separating various mixtures. Use an engineering design process to define the
             problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the system.*
Conceptual Understanding: Physical properties can be observed and measured without changing the
composition of matter. A physical change occurs when the matter’s physical appearance is altered while
leaving the composition of the matter unchanged. When two or more substances are mixed together, a
new substance with different properties can sometimes be formed, but the total amount (i.e., mass) of the
substances is conserved (i.e., total mass stays the same). In a chemical change, the composition of the
original matter is altered to create a new substance. A different compound is present at the completion of
the chemical change.

P.5.5C       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the difference between physical and
             chemical changes.
P.5.5C.1     Analyze and communicate the results of chemical changes that result in the formation of new
             materials (e.g., decaying, burning, rusting, or cooking).
P.5.5C.2     Analyze and communicate the results of physical changes to a substance that results in a
             reversible change (e.g., changes in states of matter with the addition or removal of energy,
             changes in size or shape, or combining/separating mixtures or solutions).
P.5.5C.3     Analyze and interpret data to support claims that when two substances are mixed, the total
             weight of matter is conserved.
                                   GRADE FIVE: Physical Science
P.5.6 Motions, Forces, and Energy
Conceptual Understanding: Gravity is a force that draws objects to Earth. This force acting on an object
near Earth's surface pulls that object toward the planet's center. The motion of an object can be described
in terms of its position, direction, and speed. Multiple factors determine the rate and motion of an object.
Other than Earth, any celestial objects will exert varying gravitational pulls on other objects according to
their mass and density.
P.5.6        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the factors that affect the motion of
             an object through a study of Newton's Laws of Motion.
P.5.6.1      Obtain and communicate information describing gravity's effect on an object.
P.5.6.2      Predict the future motion of various objects based on past observation and measurement of
             position, direction, and speed.
P.5.6.3      Develop and use models to explain how the amount or type of force, both contact and non-
             contact, affects the motion of an object.
P.5.6.4      Plan and conduct scientific investigations to test the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces
             on the speed and/or direction of objects in motion.
P.5.6.5      Predict how a change of force, mass, and/or friction affects the motion of an object to convert
             potential energy into kinetic energy.
P.5.6.6      Design a system to increase the effects of friction on the motion of an object (e.g., non-slip
             surfaces or vehicle braking systems or flaps on aircraft wings). Use an engineering design
             process to define the problem, design, construct, evaluate, and improve the system.*
                             GRADE FIVE: Earth and Space Science
E.5.8 Earth and the Universe
Conceptual Understanding: Astronomy is the study of celestial objects in our solar system and beyond. A
solar system includes one or more suns (stars) and all other objects orbiting in that system. Planets in our
night sky change positions and are not always visible from Earth as they orbit our sun. Stars that can be
seen in the night sky lie beyond our solar system and appear in patterns called constellations.
Constellations can be used for navigation and appear to move together across the sky because of Earth’s
rotation and revolution around the sun.
E.5.8A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the locations of objects in the
             universe.
       45  Grade Five Science


         MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                              2018
E.5.8A.1    Develop and use scaled models of Earth’s solar system to demonstrate the size, composition
            (i.e., rock or gas), location, and order of the planets as they orbit the Sun.
E.5.8A.2    Use evidence to argue why the sun appears brighter than other stars.
E.5.8A.3    Describe how constellations appear to move from Earth’s perspective throughout the seasons
            (e.g., Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, and Orion).
E.5.8A.4    Construct scientific arguments to support claims about the importance of astronomy in
            navigation and exploration, including the use of telescopes, compasses, and star charts.
Conceptual Understanding: Earth orbits around the sun as the moon orbits around Earth. The revolution
and rotation of Earth on a tilted axis provide evidence of patterns that can be observed, studied, and
predicted.
E.5.8B      Students will demonstrate an understanding of the principles that govern moon
            phases, day and night, appearance of objects in the sky, and seasonal changes.
E.5.8B.1    Analyze and interpret data from observations and research (e.g., from NASA, NOAA, or the
            USGS) to explain patterns in the location, movement, and appearance of the moon throughout
            a month and over the course of a year.
E.5.8B.2    Develop and use a model of the Earth-Sun-Moon system to analyze the cyclic patterns of lunar
            phases, solar and lunar eclipses, and seasons.
E.5.8B.3    Develop and use models to explain the factors (e.g., tilt, revolution, and angle of sunlight) that
            result in Earth’s seasonal changes.
E.5.8B.4    Obtain information and analyze how our understanding of the solar system has evolved over
            time (e.g., Earth-centered model of Aristotle and Ptolemy compared to the Sun-centered model
            of Copernicus and Galileo).
                            GRADE FIVE: Earth and Space Science
E.5.10 Earth’s Resources
Conceptual Understanding: Human activities can impact natural processes and availability of resources. To
reduce impacts on the environment (including humans), various best practices can be used. New and
improved conservation practices are constantly being developed and tested.
E.5.10      Students will demonstrate an understanding of the effects of human interaction with
            Earth and how Earth’s natural resources can be protected and conserved.
E.5.10.1    Collect and organize scientific ideas that individuals and communities can use to conserve
            Earth’s natural resources and systems (e.g., implementing watershed management practices to
            conserve water resources, utilizing no-till farming to improve soil fertility, reducing emissions to
            abate air pollution, or recycling to reduce landfill waste).
E.5.10.2    Design a process for better preparing communities to withstand manmade or natural disasters
            (e.g., removing oil from water or soil, systems that reduce the impact of floods, structures that
            resist hurricane forces). Use an engineering design process to define the problem, design,
            construct, evaluate, and improve the disaster plan.*

                                         GRADES 6-8 OVERVIEW
Critical to middle school students is the foundation needed to be successful in high school science. In
Grades 6-8, students use an integrated science curriculum to develop and plan controlled investigations
and create more explicit and detailed models and explanations. Students must have opportunities to
develop the skills necessary to engage in scientific and technical reasoning that are necessary for success in
college, careers, and citizenship.
Because of using an integrated science model, the development of themes for each grade became
necessary to assure continuity of thought processes.
     • Grade 6 – Structure and Function
     • Grade 7 – Systems and Cycles
     • Grade 8 – Cause and Effect
In Grade 6, students need more tangible concepts, but by Grade 8, the complexity of the content increases
to abstract cause and effect relationships. Explaining patterns and making predictions based on an
understanding of cause and effect allows students to conceptualize and describe the relationships among
natural phenomena. By building complexity into the standards, student skill sets are further strengthened
as they prepare for high school courses.
The core science content utilizes hands-on classroom instruction to reinforce the seven crosscutting
concepts (i.e., patterns; cause and effect; scale, portion, and quantity; systems and system models; energy
and matter; structure and function; and stability and change).
SEPs are in life science, physical science, and Earth and space science. The SEPs are designed so that
students may develop skills and apply knowledge to solve real-life problems. While presented as distinct
skill sets, the eight practices intentionally overlap and interconnect as students explore the science
concepts. Some examples of specific skills students should develop in Grades 6-8 are listed below.
     1. Ask questions to explain how density of matter (observable in various objects) is affected by a
          change in heat and/or pressure.
     2. Develop and use models to show relationships among the increasing complexity of multicellular
          organisms (cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms) and how they serve the needs of the
          organism.
     3. Conduct simple investigations about the performance of waves to describe their behavior (e.g.,
          refraction, reflection, transmission, and absorption) as they interact with various materials (e.g.,
          lenses, mirrors, and prisms).
     4. Analyze and interpret data to explain how the processes of photosynthesis, and cellular respiration
          (aerobic and anaerobic) work together to meet the needs of plants and animals.
     5. Use mathematical computation and diagrams to calculate the sum of forces acting on various
          objects.
     6. Construct an explanation for how climate is determined in an area using global and surface features
          (e.g. latitude, elevation, shape of the land, distance from water, global winds, and ocean currents).
     7. Engage in scientific argument based on current evidence to determine whether climate change
          happens naturally or is being accelerated through the influence of man.
     8. Obtain and evaluate scientific information to explain the relationship between seeing color and the
          transmission, absorption, or reflection of light waves by various materials.

          MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                            2018
Curricula and instructions that integrate science and engineering practices should reflect the skills outlined
above.
The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a step-by-step method of devising a system, component, or process
to meet desired needs. This is similar to the “scientific method” which is taught to young scientists.
However, the EDP is a flexible process. Students can begin at any step, focus on just one step, move back
and forth between steps, or repeat the cycle. Engineering standards are represented in some performance
objectives with grade-banded, specific wording that will prompt students to approach learning and
exploration using the engineering process. These performance objectives are marked with an * at the end
of the statement. Professional development and teacher resources will be developed for teachers as EDP is
incorporated into Mississippi standards.
The use of science and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts will actively engage students in
science, building on their natural curiosity and encouraging further study in science and engineering fields.
As science also requires the ability to think and reason, students will therefore also develop the skills
necessary to be successful in college, career, and society.

                                        Theme: Structure and Function
Grade 6 students need concrete opportunities to engage with natural phenomena. The integration of Earth
and space, life, and physical sciences gives students many opportunities to explore the relationship of
structure and function in the world around them. By analyzing the macro- and microscopic world, the role
of cells in life functions, the interdependence in ecosystems, the diversity of life on Earth, the relationship
between force and motion, and the organization and interactions of objects in the universe, Grade 6
students can make claims and provide evidence about structure-function relationships in different scientific
domains.
                                         GRADE SIX: Life Science
L.6.1 Hierarchical Organization
Conceptual Understanding: Living things are distinguished from nonliving things by several characteristics.
All living things are comprised of one (unicellular) or more (multicellular) cells, which are the smallest units
of life. Cells carry out life functions and undergo cell division using specialized structures that allow them to
acquire energy and water, grow, reproduce, dispose of waste, and survive. Multicellular organisms are
organized in a hierarchy of increasing complexity with related, specialized structures and functions.
L.6.1          Students will demonstrate an understanding that living things range from simple to
               complex organisms, are organized hierarchically, and function as whole living
               systems.

L.6.1.3        Develop and use models to explain how specific cellular components (cell wall, cell membrane,
               nucleus, chloroplast, vacuole, and mitochondria) function together to support the life of
               prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to include plants, animals, fungi, protists, and bacteria
               (not to include biochemical function of cells or cell part).

L.6.3 Ecology and Interdependence
Conceptual Understanding: All organisms depend on biotic and abiotic factors for survival. When any
environmental factor changes, a corresponding change in diversity and population of organisms will also
occur. The environment and the organism in which it lives are therefore interdependent.
L.6.3          Students will demonstrate an understanding of the relationships among survival,
               environmental changes, and diversity as they relate to the interactions of organisms,
               populations, and the environment.

              (limiting factors, natural disasters) can lead to population changes within an ecosystem.

              (predation, competition, cooperation, or symbiotic relationships).
L.6.3.5       Develop and use food chains, webs, and pyramids to analyze how energy is transferred through
              an ecosystem from producers (autotrophs) to consumers (heterotrophs, including humans) to
              decomposers.

L.6.4 Adaptation and Diversity
Conceptual Understanding: Because living organisms are so diverse, scientists have created a system by
which living things are organized into groups according to their characteristics (physical and/or genomic) for
identification and research purposes. The kingdoms are very diverse but also have quite a bit in common.
Organisms exhibit structural and behavioral characteristics such as adaptations, patterns of growth and
development, and life cycles that increase their chances of reproduction and survival in a changing
environment.
L.6.4         Students will demonstrate an understanding of classification tools and models such
              as dichotomous keys to classify representative organisms based on the characteristics
              of the kingdoms: Archaebacteria, Eubacteria, Protists, Fungi, Plants, and Animals.
L.6.4.1       Compare and contrast modern classification techniques (e.g., analyzing genetic material) to the
              historical practices used by scientists such as Aristotle and Carolus Linnaeus.

              fungi, protists, bacteria). Support claims that organisms have shared structural and behavioral
              characteristics.

              to stimuli (e.g., bread mold, rotting plant material).
L.6.4.4       Conduct investigations using a microscope or multimedia source to compare the characteristics
              of protists (euglena, paramecium, amoeba) and the methods they use to obtain energy and
              move through their environment (e.g., pond water).
L.6.4.5       Engage in scientific arguments to support claims that bacteria (Archaebacteria and Eubacteria)
              and viruses can be both helpful and harmful to other organisms and the environment.

P.6.6 Motions, Forces, and Energy
Conceptual Understanding: Newton’s Laws describe forces and motion affecting substances in various
environments and situations. Motion is determined by the amount of force applied. Focusing on magnetic,
frictional, and gravitational forces will provide an understanding of the relationship between distance and
contact forces.

E.6.8 Earth and the Universe
Conceptual Understanding: The hierarchical organization of the universe is the result of complex structure
and function. Current theories suggest that time began with a period of extremely rapid expansion.
Presently, Earth’s solar system consists of the Sun and other objects that are held in orbit by the Sun’s
gravitational force. The interactions of the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun have effects that can be observed
on Earth. Various technologies have aided in our understanding of Earth’s place in the universe.
E.6.8       Students will demonstrate an understanding of Earth’s place in the universe and the
            interactions of the solar system (sun, planets, their moons, comets, and asteroids)
            using evidence from multiple scientific resources to explain how these objects are
            held in orbit around the Sun because of its gravitational pull.

Students relate systems and cycles through analyzing various small scale and large scale phenomena. Using
scientific methods, students can connect Earth’s systems with the flow of energy in supporting living and
nonliving organisms and specific interactions of matter. Students use multiple investigative methods to
discover evidence, make claims, and generate explanations about systems and cycles that take place on
Earth. A focus on organization and cycles of matter requires students to apply skills and make connections
across genres of science since most complex cycles have multiple interactions.

L.7.3 Ecology and Interdependence
Conceptual Understanding: The emphasis is on predicting consistent patterns of interactions among
different cycling systems in terms of the relationships between organisms and abiotic components within
ecosystems. Rearrangement of food molecules through chemical processes in cellular respiration and
photosynthesis is an important part of energy cycling in all life systems. Preservation of biodiversity and
consideration of human impacts are themes in maintaining ecosystem services.
L.7.3        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the importance that matter cycles
             between living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem to sustain life on Earth.

             and nitrogen through ecosystems to organisms.

             respiration (aerobic and anaerobic) work together to meet the needs of plants and animals.
L.7.3.3      Use models to describe how food molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) are processed
             through chemical reactions using oxygen (aerobic) to form new molecules.
L.7.3.4      Explain how disruptions in cycles (e.g., water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen) affect biodiversity
             and ecosystem services (e.g., water, food, and medications) which are needed to sustain human
             life on Earth.
L.7.3.5      Design solutions for sustaining the health of ecosystems to maintain biodiversity and the
             resources needed by humans for survival (e.g., water purification, nutrient recycling, prevention
             of soil erosion, and prevention or management of invasive species).*

properties (e.g., mass, density, solubility) using chemical processes and experimentation. Changes to
substances can either be physical or chemical.

             of matter.

             boiling/melting point, density, heat/electrical conductivity, color, and magnetic properties).

P.7.5A.3    Compare and contrast chemical and physical properties (e.g., combustion, oxidation, pH,
            solubility, reaction with water).
Conceptual Understanding: Matter is made of atoms and/or molecules that are in constant motion. The
movement of the atoms and molecules depends on the amount of energy in the system at the time. The
changes of state that occur with variations in temperature or pressure can be described and predicted
using these models of matter.
P.7.5B      Students will demonstrate an understanding about the effects of temperature and
            pressure on physical state, molecular motion, and molecular interactions.
P.7.5B.1    Make predictions about the effect of temperature and pressure on the relative motion of atoms
            and molecules (speed, expansion, and condensation) relative to recent breakthroughs in
            polymer and materials science (e.g. self-healing protective films, silicone computer processors,
            pervious/porous concrete).
P.7.5B.2    Use evidence from multiple scientific investigations to communicate the relationships between
            pressure, volume, density, and temperature of a gas.
P.7.5B.3    Ask questions to explain how density of matter (observable in various objects) is affected by a
            change in heat and/or pressure.
Conceptual Understanding: Atoms are the basic building blocks of ordinary elements. Compounds are
substances composed of two or more elements. Chemical formulas can be used to describe compounds.
The periodic table orders elements horizontally by the number of protons in the atom’s nucleus and places
those with similar chemical properties in columns. The element position on the periodic table can also be
used to predict the type of bonding that most commonly occurs between the elements.
P.7.5C      Students will demonstrate an understanding of the proper use of the periodic table to
            predict and identify elemental properties and how elements interact.

            between groups of elements (e.g., oxygen gas, ozone, water, table salt, and methane).
Conceptual Understanding: Changes to substances can either be physical or chemical. Many substances
react chemically with other substances to form new substances with different properties. Substances (such
as metals or acids) are identified according to their physical or chemical properties. Some chemical
reactions release energy and others store energy.

P.7.5D.2     Design and conduct scientific investigations to support evidence that chemical reactions (e.g.,

P.7.5D.4     Build a model to explain that chemical reactions can store (formation of bonds) or release
             energy (breaking of bonds).
Conceptual Understanding: In a chemical process, the atoms that make up original substances are
regrouped into different molecules, and these new substances have different properties from those of the
reactants. The total number of each type of atom is conserved, and the mass does not change. As these
chemical combinations take place, substances react in various ways, yet matter is always conserved in a
reaction.
P.7.5E       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the law of conservation of mass.
P.7.5E.1     Conduct simple scientific investigations to show that total mass is not altered during a chemical
             reaction in a closed system. Compare results of investigations to Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier’s
             discovery of the law of conservation of mass.

             appears to be less than the mass of reactants.
P.7.5E.3     Compare and contrast balanced and unbalanced chemical equations to demonstrate the

E.7.9 Earth’s Systems and Cycles
Conceptual Understanding: Complex patterns in the movement of air and water in the atmosphere are
major determinants of local weather. Global movements of water and its changes in form are propelled by
sunlight and gravity. Variations in temperature drive a global pattern of interconnected currents.
Interactions between sunlight, oceans, atmosphere, ice, landforms, and living things vary with latitude,
altitude, and local and regional geography. Weather is difficult to predict; however, large scale patterns and
trends in global climate, such as the gradual increase in average temperature, are more easily observed and
predicted.
E.7.9A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of how complex changes in the
             movement and patterns of air and water molecules caused by the sun, winds,
             landforms, ocean temperatures, and currents in the atmosphere are major
             determinants of local and global weather patterns.
E.7.9A.1     Analyze and interpret weather patterns from various regions to differentiate between weather
             and climate.

             features (e.g. latitude, elevation, shape of the land, distance from water, global winds and
             ocean currents).

E.7.9A.5     Analyze models to explain the cause and effect relationship between solar energy and
             convection and the resulting weather patterns and climate conditions.
E.7.9A.6     Research and use models to explain what type of weather (thunderstorms, hurricanes, and
             tornadoes) results from the movement and interactions of air masses, high and low pressure
             systems, and frontal boundaries.
E.7.9A.7     Interpret topographic maps to predict how local and regional geography affect weather
             patterns and make them difficult to predict.
Conceptual Understanding: Climate changes are defined as significant and persistent changes in an area’s
average or extreme weather conditions. Changes can occur if any of Earth’s systems change (e.g.,
composition of the atmosphere, reflectivity of Earth’s surface). The ocean exerts a major influence on
weather and climate by absorbing energy from the sun, releasing it over time, and globally redistributing it
through ocean currents. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and retain the energy radiated from
land and ocean surfaces, thereby regulating Earth’s average surface temperature and keeping it habitable.
Excess greenhouse gases could cause a detrimental impact on climate over time.
E.7.9B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between natural
             phenomena, human activity, and global climate change.
E.7.9B.1     Read and evaluate scientific or technical information assessing the evidence and bias of each
             source to explain the causes and effects of climate change.
E.7.9B.2     Interpret data about the relationship between the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil
             fuels into the atmosphere and the presence of greenhouse gases.
E.7.9B.3     Engage in scientific argument based on current evidence to determine whether climate change
             happens naturally or is being accelerated through the influence of man.
Conceptual Understanding: The tilt of Earth’s spin axis with respect to the plane of its orbit around the sun is
important for a habitable Earth. The Earth’s spin axis is tilted 23.5 degrees. Earth’s axis points in the same
direction in space no matter where Earth is in relation to the sun. The seasons are a result of this tilt and
are caused by the differential intensity of sunlight on different areas of Earth across the year.
E.7.9C       Students will demonstrate an understanding that the seasons are the direct result of
             the Earth’s tilt and the intensity of sunlight on the Earth’s hemispheres.
E.7.9C.1     Construct models and diagrams to illustrate how the tilt of Earth’s axis results in differences in
             intensity of sunlight on the Earth’s hemispheres throughout the course of one full revolution
             around the Sun.
E.7.9C.2     Investigate how variations of sunlight intensity experienced by each hemisphere (to include the
             equator and poles) create the four seasons.

Since causes of complex phenomena and systems are not always immediately or physically visible to
students, the need to develop abstract thinking skills is a significant outcome for Grade 8. Explaining
patterns and making predictions based on an understanding of cause and effect allows students to
conceptualize and describe the relationships among natural phenomena. In Grade 8, some examples of the
relationships include the role of genetics in reproduction and heredity, the biology that explains unity and
diversity, the transfer of energy, the result of dynamic changes to the Earth’s surface, and human impact on
the biosphere.

L.8.2 Reproduction and Heredity
Conceptual Understanding: Organisms reproduce, either sexually or asexually, and transfer their genetic
information to their offspring. The process of passing genetic information to offspring is inheritance. During
sexual reproduction, genetic information is passed to offspring resulting in similarities and differences
between parental organisms and their offspring. There are advantages and disadvantages of the two types
of reproduction.
L.8.2A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of how sexual reproduction results in
             offspring with genetic variation while asexual reproduction results in offspring with
             identical genetic information.
L.8.2A.1     Obtain and communicate information about the relationship of genes, chromosomes, and DNA,
             and construct explanations comparing their relationship to inherited characteristics.
L.8.2A.2     Create a diagram of mitosis and explain its role in asexual reproduction, which results in
             offspring with identical genetic information.
L.8.2A.3     Construct explanations of how genetic information is transferred during meiosis.
L.8.2A.4     Engage in discussion using models and evidence to explain that sexual reproduction produces
             offspring that have a new combination of genetic information different from either parent.
L.8.2A.5     Compare and contrast advantages and disadvantages of asexual and sexual reproduction.
Conceptual Understanding: Inheritance is the key process causing similarities between parental organisms
and their offspring. Organisms that reproduce sexually transfer genetic information (DNA) to their
offspring. This transfer of genetic information through inheritance leads to greater similarity among
individuals within a population than between populations. Genetic changes can accumulate through natural
selection or mutation that can lead to the evolution of species. Humans can manipulate genetic information
using technology.
L.8.2B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the differences in inherited and
             acquired characteristics and how environmental factors (natural selection) and the
             use of technologies (selective breeding, genetic engineering) influence the transfer of
             genetic information.
L.8.2B.1     Construct an argument based on evidence for how environmental and genetic factors influence
             the growth of organisms.
L.8.2B.2     Use various scientific resources to research and support the historical findings of Gregor Mendel
             to explain the basic principles of heredity.

L.8.2B.4     Debate the ethics of artificial selection (selective breeding, genetic engineering) and the societal
             impacts of humans changing the inheritance of desired traits in organisms.
Conceptual Understanding: Genes are located on the chromosomes of cells, with each chromosome pair
containing two variations of each distinct gene. Each distinct gene chiefly controls the production of a
specific protein, which in turn affects the traits of the individual. Changes (mutations) in genes can result in
changes to proteins, which can affect the structures and functions of the organism and thereby change
traits.
L.8.2C       Students will demonstrate an understanding that chromosomes contain many
             distinct genes and that each gene holds the instructions for the production of a
             specific protein, which in turn affects the traits of an individual.
L.8.2C.1     Communicate through diagrams that chromosomes contain many distinct genes and that each
             gene holds the instructions for the production of specific proteins, which in turn affects the traits
             of the individual (not to include transcription or translation).
L.8.2C.2     Construct scientific arguments from evidence to support claims about the potentially harmful,
             beneficial, or neutral effects of genetic mutations on organisms.
                                     GRADE EIGHT: Life Science
L.8.4 Adaptation and Diversity
Conceptual Understanding: The scientific theory of evolution underlies the study of biology and provides
an explanation for both the diversity of life on Earth and similarities of all organisms at the chemical,
cellular, and molecular level. Multiple forms of scientific evidence support the theory of evolution.
Adaptations are physical or behavioral changes that are inherited and enhance the ability of an organism to
survive and reproduce in a particular environment.
L.8.4A       Students will demonstrate an understanding of the process of natural selection, in
             which variations in a population increase some individuals’ likelihood of surviving and
             reproducing in a changing environment.
L.8.4A.1     Use various scientific resources to analyze the historical findings of Charles Darwin to explain
             basic principles of natural selection.
L.8.4A.2     Investigate to construct explanations about natural selection that connect growth, survival, and
             reproduction to genetic factors, environmental factors, food intake, and interactions with other
             organisms.
Conceptual Understanding: Adaptation by natural selection acting over generations is one important
process by which species change over time in response to changes in environmental conditions. The traits
of organisms that survive a change in the environment are inherited by offspring and become more
common in the population. The traits of organisms that cannot survive a change in the environment are not
passed to offspring and become less common. In separated populations, the changes can be large enough
that the populations evolve to become separate species. Extinction occurs when the environment changes
and the adaptive characteristics of a species, including its behaviors, are insufficient to allow its survival.

L.8.4B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of how similarities and differences
             among living and extinct species provide evidence that changes have occurred in
             organisms over time and that similarity of characteristics provides evidence of
             common ancestry.
L.8.4B.1     Analyze and interpret data (e.g. pictures, graphs) to explain how natural selection may lead to
             increases and decreases of specific traits in populations over time.
L.8.4B.2     Construct written and verbal explanations to describe how genetic variations of traits in a
             population increase some organisms’ probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific
             environment.
L.8.4B.3     Obtain and evaluate scientific information to explain that separated populations, that remain
             separated, can evolve through mutations to become a new species (speciation).
L.8.4B.4     Analyze displays of pictorial data to compare and contrast embryological and
             homologous/analogous structures across multiple species to identify evolutionary relationships.
                                  GRADE EIGHT: Physical Science
P.8.6 Motions, Forces, and Energy
Conceptual Understanding: Waves have energy that is transferred when they interact with various types of
matter. A repeating pattern of motion allows the transfer of energy from place to place without overall
displacement of matter. All types of waves have some features in common. When waves interact, they
affect each other resulting in changes to the resonance. Many modern technologies are based on waves
and their interactions with matter.
P.8.6        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the properties, behaviors, and
             application of waves.
P.8.6.1      Collect, organize, and interpret data about the characteristics of sound and light waves to
             construct explanations about the relationship between matter and energy.
P.8.6.2      Investigate research-based mechanisms for capturing and converting wave energy (frequency,
             amplitude, wavelength, and speed) into electrical energy.
P.8.6.3      Conduct simple investigations about the performance of waves to describe their behavior
             (e.g., refraction, reflection, transmission, and absorption) as they interact with various materials
             (e.g., lenses, mirrors, and prisms).
P.8.6.4      Use scientific processes to plan and conduct controlled investigations to conclude sound is a
             wave phenomenon that is characterized by amplitude and frequency.
P.8.6.5      Conduct scientific investigations that describe the behavior of sound when resonance changes
             (e.g., waves in a stretched string and design of musical instruments).
P.8.6.6      Obtain and evaluate scientific information to explain the relationship between seeing color and
             the transmission, absorption, or reflection of light waves by various materials.
P.8.6.7      Research the historical significance of wave technology to explain how digitized tools have
             evolved to encode and transmit information (e.g., telegraph, cell phones, and wireless computer
             networks).
P.8.6.8      Compare and contrast the behavior of sound and light waves to determine which types of waves
             need a medium for transmission.

E.8.7 Earth’s Structure and History
Conceptual Understanding: Fossils are preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past.
Thousands of layers of sedimentary rock not only provide evidence of the history of Earth itself but also of
changes in organisms whose fossil remains have been found in those layers. The collection of fossils and
their placement in chronological order (e.g., through the location of rock layers or through radioactive
dating) is collectively known as the fossil record. It documents the existence, diversity, extinction, and
change of many life forms throughout the history of life on Earth.
E.8.7        Students will demonstrate an understanding of geological evidence to analyze
             patterns in Earth’s major events, processes, and evolution in history.
E.8.7.1      Use scientific evidence to create a timeline of Earth’s history that depicts relative dates from
             index fossil records and layers of rock (strata).
E.8.7.2      Create a model of the processes involved in the rock cycle and relate it to the fossil record.
E.8.7.3      Construct and analyze scientific arguments to support claims that most fossil evidence is an
             indication of the diversity of life that was present on Earth and that relationships exist between
             past and current life forms.
E.8.7.4      Use research and evidence to document how evolution has been shaped both gradually and
             through mass extinction by Earth’s varying geological conditions (e.g., climate change, meteor
             impacts, and volcanic eruptions).
                            GRADE EIGHT: Earth and Space Science
E.8.9 Earth’s Systems and Cycles
Conceptual Understanding: Earth systems and cycles are characterized by cause and effect relationships.
All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among the planet’s
systems. Landforms and water distribution result from constructive and destructive processes. Physical and
chemical interactions among rocks, sediments, water, air, and organisms produce soil. Water’s
movements—both on the land and underground—cause weathering and erosion. Plate tectonics is the
unifying theory that explains the past and current crustal movements at the surface. This theory provides a
framework for understanding geological history. Mapping land and water patterns based on investigations
of rocks and fossils can help forecast the proximity and probability of future events.
E.8.9A       Students will demonstrate an understanding that physical processes and major
             geological events (e.g., plate movement, volcanic activity, mountain building,
             weathering, erosion) are powered by the Sun and the Earth’s internal heat and have
             occurred over millions of years.
E.8.9A.1     Investigate and explain how the flow of Earth’s internal energy drives the cycling of matter
             through convection currents between Earth’s surface and the deep interior causing plate
             movements.
E.8.9A.2     Explore and debate theories of plate tectonics to form conclusions about past and current
             movements of rocks at Earth’s surface throughout history.
E.8.9A.3     Map land and water patterns from various time periods and use rocks and fossils to report
             evidence of how Earth’s plates have moved great distances, collided, and spread apart.
E.8.9A.4     Research and assess the credibility of scientific ideas to debate and discuss how Earth’s
             constructive and destructive processes have changed Earth’s surface at varying time and spatial
             scales.

E.8.9A.5     Use models that demonstrate convergent and divergent plate movements that are responsible
             for most landforms and the distribution of most rocks and minerals within Earth’s crust.
E.8.9A.6     Design and conduct investigations to evaluate the chemical and physical processes involved in
             the formation of soils.
E.8.9A.7     Explain the interconnected relationship between surface water and groundwater.
Conceptual Understanding: Natural processes can cause sudden or gradual changes to Earth’s systems.
Some may adversely affect humans such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. Mapping the history of
natural hazards in a region, combined with an understanding of related geological forces can help
forecast the locations and likelihoods of future events.
E.8.9B       Students will demonstrate an understanding of natural hazards (volcanic eruptions,
             severe weather, earthquakes) and construct explanations for why some hazards are
             predictable and others are not.
E.8.9B.1     Research and map various types of natural hazards to determine their impact on society.
E.8.9B.2     Compare and contrast technologies that predict natural hazards to identify which types of
             technologies are most effective.
E.8.9B.3     Using an engineering design process, create mechanisms to improve community resilience,
             which safeguard against natural hazards (e.g., building restrictions in flood or tidal zones,
             regional watershed management, Firewise construction).*
                           GRADE EIGHT: Earth and Space Science
E.8.10 Earth’s Resources
Conceptual Understanding: Humans depend on Earth’s land, ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere for many
different resources, both renewable and nonrenewable. Human activities have significantly altered the
biosphere, sometimes damaging, or destroying natural habitats that could cause extinction or the threat of
extinction of many species. Past and present geological events have distributed resources unevenly around
the planet; therefore, there has been an increase in, and continued need for, technology to harness
available resources and develop alternatives.
E.8.10       Students will demonstrate an understanding that a decrease in natural resources is
             directly related to the increase in human population on Earth and must be conserved.
E.8.10.1     Read and evaluate scientific information about advancements in renewable and nonrenewable
             resources. Propose and defend ways to decrease national and global dependency on
             nonrenewable resources.
E.8.10.2     Create and defend a proposal for reducing the environmental effects humans have on Earth
             (e.g., population increases, consumer demands, chemical pollution, deforestation, and change
             in average annual temperature).
E.8.10.3     Using scientific data, debate the societal advantages and disadvantages of technological
             advancements in renewable energy sources.
E.8.10.4     Using an engineering design process, develop a system to capture and distribute thermal energy
             that makes renewable energy more readily available and reduces human impact on the
             environment (e.g., building solar water heaters, conserving home energy).*

                                        GRADES 9-12 OVERVIEW
The high school curriculum provides essential preparation for all students in Grades 9-12. This experience
should promote the development of adequate scientific knowledge to allow students to make informed,
critical choices and to succeed in both the workplace and in postsecondary courses.
Content standards are integrated with scientific and engineering practices (SEPs), cross-cutting concepts,
and the use of technology to connect information gathered through scientific investigations with real-world
applications and engineering solutions to human problems. The nature of science and historical
perspectives are critical to understanding the foundation and processes of science, regardless of the
scientific discipline.
The eight SEPs should not be considered a stand-alone set of practices, as previously presented, but rather
incorporated throughout the set of content objectives. The SEPs are designed so that students may develop
skills and apply knowledge to solve real-life problems. While presented as distinct skill sets, the eight
practices intentionally overlap and interconnect as students explore the science concepts.
The core science content utilizes hands-on classroom instruction to reinforce the seven crosscutting
concepts (i.e., patterns; cause and effect; scale, portion, and quantity; systems and system models; energy
and matter; structure and function; and stability and change).
The National Academies’ (2012) research-based findings state that “the actual doing of science or
engineering can pique students’ curiosity, capture their interest and motivate their continued study…” (p.
42). Science curricula should actively engage students in learning through scientific investigations. At least
30% of the course should be dedicated to laboratory experiences, including, but not limited to:
     •    field studies and field trips
     •    manipulatives and model
     •    guided experimentation
     •    student independent research and/or science fair
     •    computer-based simulations
     •    case studies
Technology plays multiple roles in content mastery. It encompasses students’ awareness of current
technology applications, the use of technology in data collection, and its use by teachers and students in
content delivery.
Students need to be supplied with the appropriate materials and equipment necessary to conduct scientific
investigations. Student safety and safe practices are primary concerns. For this reason, teachers should
adhere to the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) safety recommendations, which can be
accessed at http://www.nsta.org/docs/SafetyInTheScienceClassroom.pdf.
The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a step-by-step method of devising a system, component, or process
to meet desired needs. This is similar to the “scientific method” which is taught to young scientists.
However, the EDP is a flexible process. Students can begin at any step, focus on just one step, move back
and forth between steps, or repeat the cycle. Engineering standards are represented in some performance
objectives with specific wording that will prompt students to approach learning and exploration using the
engineering process. These performance objectives are marked with an * at the end of the statement.
Professional development and teacher resources will be developed for teachers as EDP is incorporated into
Mississippi standards.

     hypotheses and predictions, and develop explanations or evaluate design solutions, which require the
     following:
          o   Identify dependent and independent variables and appropriate controls.
          o   Select and use appropriate tools or instruments to collect data, and represent data in an
              appropriate form.
          o   Analyze and interpret various types of data sets, using appropriate mathematics, in order to
              verify or refute the hypothesis or determine an optimal design solution.
          o   Construct an explanation of observed relationships between variables.
          o   Communicate scientific and/or technical information in various formats.

                                                    BIOLOGY
Biology, a one-credit course, is a laboratory-based course that is designed to build a life science foundation
emphasizing patterns, processes, and interactions among organisms. Students are expected to master
conceptual understandings based on both individual investigations and the investigations conducted by
others. Individual learning experiences are used to support claims and engage in evidence-based
arguments. In this way, students explore the organization of life; the interdependence between organisms
and their environment; the chemical composition of life; the role of DNA, RNA, and protein in cellular
structure and function; inheritance; and evolution. Local resources coupled with external resources,
including evidence-based literature, will be used to extend and increase the complexity of these core ideas.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate
explanations about the natural world to increase the depth of understanding based on evidence, logic, and
innovation. These concepts are expected to appear throughout the course. As a laboratory-based course,
students are expected to utilize science and engineering practices to design and conduct investigations
using appropriate equipment, measurement (SI units), and safety procedures. Students should also design
data tables and draw conclusions using mathematical computations and/or graphical analysis. The
recommendation is that students should be actively engaged in inquiry activities, lab experiences, and
scientific research (projects) for a minimum of 30% of class time.
The standards and performance objectives do not have to be taught in the order presented in this
document. The performance objectives are intentionally broad to allow school districts and teachers the
flexibility to create a curriculum that meets the needs of their students.
Objectives identified by “Enrichment:” are considered enrichment material that may be expanded upon as
time permits. Engineering standards are represented in some performance objectives with specific wording
that will prompt students to approach learning and exploration using the engineering process. These
performance objectives are marked with an * at the end of the statement.

BIO.1 Cells as a System
Conceptual Understanding: Biologists have determined that organisms share unique characteristics that
differentiate them from non-living things. Organisms range from very simple to extremely complex.

Conceptual Understanding: Organisms are composed of four primary macromolecules: carbohydrates,
lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions between molecules
within cells. Cells continuously utilize materials obtained from the environment and the breakdown of
other macromolecules to synthesize their own large macromolecules for cellular structures and functions.
These metabolic reactions require enzymes for catalysis.
BIO.1B       Students will analyze the structure and function of the macromolecules that make up
             cells.
BIO.1B.1     Develop and use models to compare and contrast the structure and function of carbohydrates,
             lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) in organisms.
BIO.1B.2     Design and conduct an experiment to determine how enzymes react given various
             environmental conditions (i.e., pH, temperature, and concentration). Analyze, interpret, graph,
             and present data to explain how those changing conditions affect the enzyme activity and the
             rate of the reactions that take place in biological organisms.
Conceptual Understanding: Cells are the basic units of all organisms, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in key structural features, but both can perform all functions
necessary for life.
BIO.1C       Students will relate the diversity of organelles to a variety of specialized cellular
             functions.
BIO.1C.1     Develop and use models to explore how specialized structures within cells (e.g., nucleus,
             cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, mitochondria,
             chloroplast, centrosomes, and vacuoles) interact to carry out the functions necessary for
             organism survival.
BIO.1C.2     Investigate to compare and contrast prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells, and plant, animal,
             and fungal cells.
BIO.1C.3     Contrast the structure of viruses with that of cells, and explain why viruses must use living cells
             to reproduce.
Conceptual Understanding: The structure of the cell membrane allows it to be a selectively permeable
barrier and maintain homeostasis. Substances that enter or exit the cell must do so via the cell membrane.
This transport across the membrane may occur through a variety of mechanisms, including simple diffusion,
facilitated diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.
BIO.1D       Students will describe the structure of the cell membrane and analyze how the
             structure is related to its primary function of regulating transport in and out of cells
             to maintain homeostasis.
BIO.1D.1     Plan and conduct investigations to prove that the cell membrane is a semi-permeable, allowing
             it to maintain homeostasis with its environment through active and passive transport processes.
BIO.1D.2     Develop and use models to explain how the cell deals with imbalances of solute concentration
             across the cell membrane (i.e., hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic conditions,
             sodium/potassium pump).

Conceptual Understanding: Cells grow and reproduce through a regulated cell cycle. Within multicellular
organisms, cells repeatedly divide for repair, replacement, and growth. Likewise, an embryo begins as a
single cell that reproduces to form a complex, multicellular organism through the processes of cell division
and differentiation.
BIO.1E        Students will develop and use models to explain the role of the cell cycle during
              growth, development, and maintenance in multicellular organisms.
BIO.1E.1      Construct models to explain how the processes of cell division and cell differentiation produce
              and maintain complex multicellular organisms.
BIO.1E.2      Identify and describe the changes that occur in a cell during replication. Explore problems that
              might occur if the cell does not progress through the cycle correctly (cancer).
BIO.1E.3      Relate the processes of cellular reproduction to asexual reproduction in simple organisms (i.e.,
              budding, vegetative propagation, regeneration, binary fission). Explain why the DNA of the
              daughter cells is the same as the parent cell.
BIO.1E.4      Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to investigate the role of stem cells in
              regeneration and asexual reproduction, then develop applications of stem cell research to solve
              human medical conditions.*
                                                    Biology
BIO.2 Energy Transfer
Conceptual Understanding: Organisms require energy to perform life functions. Cells are transformers of
energy, continuously utilizing a complex sequence of reactions in which energy is transferred from one
form to another, for example, from light energy to chemical energy to kinetic energy. Emphasis is on
illustrating the inputs and outputs of matter and the transfer and transformation of energy in
photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Assessment is limited to identification of the phases (i.e., glycolysis,
citric acid cycle, and electron transport chain) in cellular respiration as well as light and light-independent
reactions of photosynthesis and does not include specific biochemical reactions within the phases.
BIO.2         Students will explain that cells transform energy through the processes of
              photosynthesis and cellular respiration to drive cellular functions.
BIO.2.1       Use models to demonstrate that ATP and ADP are cycled within a cell as a means to transfer
              energy.
BIO.2.2       Develop models of the major reactants and products of photosynthesis to demonstrate the
              transformation of light energy into stored chemical energy in cells. Emphasize the chemical
              processes in which bonds are broken and energy is released, and new bonds are formed and
              energy is stored.
BIO.2.3       Develop models of the major reactants and products of cellular respiration (aerobic and
              anaerobic) to demonstrate the transformation of the chemical energy stored in food to the
              available energy of ATP. Emphasize the chemical processes in which bonds are broken and
              energy is released, and new bonds are formed and energy is stored.
BIO.2.4       Conduct scientific investigations or computer simulations to compare aerobic and anaerobic
              cellular respiration in plants and animals, using real world examples.
BIO.2.5       Enrichment: Investigate variables (e.g., nutrient availability, temperature) that affect anaerobic
              respiration and current real-world applications of fermentation.
BIO.2.6       Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to manipulate factors involved in fermentation
              to optimize energy production.*

BIO.3 Reproduction and Heredity
Conceptual Understanding: Somatic cells contain homologous pairs of chromosomes, one member of each
pair obtained from each parent, that form a diploid set of chromosomes in each cell. These chromosomes
are similar in genetic information but may contain different alleles of these genes. For sexual reproduction,
an offspring must inherit a haploid set from each parent. Haploid gametes are formed by meiosis, a
specialized cell division in which the chromosome number is reduced by half. During meiosis, members of a
homologous pair may exchange information and then are randomly sorted into gametes resulting in genetic
variation in sex cells.
BIO.3A       Students will develop and use models to explain the role of meiosis in the production
             of haploid gametes required for sexual reproduction.
BIO.3A.1     Model sex cell formation (meiosis) and combination (fertilization) to demonstrate the
             maintenance of chromosome number through each generation in sexually reproducing
             populations. Explain why the DNA of the daughter cells is different from the DNA of the parent
             cell.
BIO.3A.2     Compare and contrast mitosis and meiosis in terms of reproduction.
BIO.3A.3     Investigate chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down syndrome, Turner’s syndrome, and
             Klinefelter syndrome) that might arise from errors in meiosis (nondisjunction) and how these
             abnormalities are identified (karyotypes).
Conceptual Understanding: Offspring inherit DNA from their parents. The genes contained in the DNA
(genotype) determine the traits expressed in the offspring’s phenotype. Alleles of a gene may demonstrate
various patterns of inheritance. These patterns of inheritance may be followed through multiple
generations within families.
BIO.3B       Students will analyze and interpret data collected from probability calculations to
             explain the variation of expressed traits within a population.
BIO.3B.1     Demonstrate Mendel’s law of dominance and segregation using mathematics to predict
             phenotypic and genotypic ratios by constructing Punnett squares with both homozygous and
             heterozygous allele pairs.
BIO.3B.2     Illustrate Mendel’s law of independent assortment using Punnett squares and/or the product
             rule of probability to analyze monohybrid crosses.
BIO.3B.3     Investigate traits that follow non-Mendelian inheritance patterns (e.g., incomplete dominance,
             codominance, multiple alleles in human blood types, and sex-linkage).
BIO.3B.4     Analyze and interpret data (e.g., pedigrees, family, and population studies) regarding
             Mendelian and complex genetic traits (e.g., sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, muscular
             dystrophy, color-blindness, and hemophilia) to determine patterns of inheritance and disease
             risk.
Conceptual Understanding: Gene expression results in the production of proteins and thus determines the
phenotypes of the organism. Changes in the DNA occur throughout an organism’s life. Mutations are a
source of genetic variation that may have a positive, negative, or no effect on the organism.
BIO.3C       Students will construct an explanation based on evidence to describe how the
             structure and nucleotide base sequence of DNA determines the structure of proteins
             or RNA that carry out essential functions of life.

          MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE- and CAREER-READINESS STANDARDS for SCIENCE                            2018
BIO.3C.1     Develop and use models to explain the relationship between DNA, genes, and chromosomes in
             coding the instructions for the traits transferred from parent to offspring.
BIO.3C.2     Evaluate the mechanisms of transcription and translation in protein synthesis.
BIO.3C.3     Use models to predict how various changes in the nucleotide sequence (e.g., point mutations,
             deletions, and additions) will affect the resulting protein product and the subsequent inherited
             trait.
BIO.3C.4     Research and identify how DNA technology benefits society. Engage in scientific argument from
             evidence over the ethical issues surrounding the use of DNA technology (e.g., cloning, transgenic
             organisms, stem cell research, and the Human Genome Project, gel electrophoresis).
BIO.3C.5     Enrichment: Investigate current biotechnological applications in the study of the genome (e.g.,
             transcriptome, proteome, individualized sequencing, and individualized gene therapy).
                                                    Biology
BIO.4 Adaptations and Evolution
Conceptual Understanding: Evolution is a key unifying principle in biology. Differentiating between organic
and chemical evolution and the analysis of the gradual changes in populations over time, helps students
understand common features and differences between species and thus the relatedness between species.
There are several factors that affect how natural selection acts on populations within their environments
leading to speciation, extinction, and the current diversity of life on earth.
BIO.4        Students will analyze and interpret evidence to explain the unity and diversity of life.
BIO.4.1      Use models to differentiate between organic and chemical evolution, illustrating the steps
             leading to aerobic heterotrophs and photosynthetic autotrophs.
BIO.4.2      Evaluate empirical evidence of common ancestry and biological evolution, including
             comparative anatomy (e.g., homologous structures and embryological similarities), fossil
             record, molecular/biochemical similarities (e.g., gene and protein homology), and
             biogeographic distribution.
BIO.4.3      Construct cladograms/phylogenetic trees to illustrate relatedness between species.
BIO.4.4      Design models and use simulations to investigate the interaction between changing
             environments and genetic variation in natural selection leading to adaptations in populations
             and differential success of populations.
BIO.4.5      Use Darwin's Theory to explain how genetic variation, competition, overproduction, and
             unequal reproductive success acts as driving forces of natural selection and evolution.
BIO.4.6      Construct explanations for the mechanisms of speciation (e.g., geographic and reproductive
             isolation).
BIO.4.7      Enrichment: Construct explanations for how various disease agents (bacteria, viruses,
             chemicals) can influence natural selection.
                                                    Biology
BIO.5 Interdependence of Organisms and Their Environments
Conceptual Understanding: Complex interactions within an ecosystem affect the numbers and types of
organisms that survive. Fluctuations in conditions can affect the ecosystem’s function, resources, and
habitat availability. Ecosystems are subject to carrying capacities and can only support a limited number of
organisms and populations. Factors that can affect the carrying capacities of populations are both biotic
and abiotic.

             their environment.
BIO.5.1      Illustrate levels of ecological hierarchy, including organism, population, community, ecosystem,
             biome, and biosphere.
BIO.5.2      Analyze models of the cycling of matter (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water)
             between abiotic and biotic factors in an ecosystem and evaluate the ability of these cycles to
             maintain the health and sustainability of the ecosystem.
BIO.5.3      Analyze and interpret quantitative data to construct an explanation for the effects of
             greenhouse gases on the carbon dioxide cycle and global climate.
BIO.5.4      Develop and use models to describe the flow of energy and amount of biomass through food
             chains, food webs, and food pyramids.
BIO.5.5      Evaluate symbiotic relationships (e.g., mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism) and other co-
             evolutionary (e.g., predator-prey, cooperation, competition, and mimicry) relationships within
             specific environments.
BIO.5.6      Analyze and interpret population data, both density-dependent and density-independent, to
             define limiting factors. Use graphical representations (growth curves) to illustrate the carrying
             capacity within ecosystems.
BIO.5.7      Investigate and evaluate factors involved in primary and secondary ecological succession using
             local, real world examples.
BIO.5.8      Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to create a solution that addresses changing
             ecological conditions (e.g., climate change, invasive species, loss of biodiversity, human
             population growth, habitat destruction, biomagnification, or natural phenomena).*
BIO.5.9      Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to investigate and model current technological
             uses of biomimicry to address solutions to real-world problems.*

Botany, a one-half credit course, is a laboratory-based course applying basic biological principles to the
study of plants. Topics include morphological characteristics of each division and variation in their
reproduction, physiology, taxonomy, evolution, and the interactions of human society and plants.
Laboratory activities, research, the use of technology, and the effective communication of results through
various methods are integral components of this course. It is recommended that Botany is taken after the
successful completion of Biology.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate
explanations about the natural world to increase the depth of understanding based on evidence, logic, and
innovation. These concepts are expected to appear throughout the course. As a laboratory-based course,
students are expected to utilize the science and engineering practices to design and conduct investigations
using appropriate equipment, measurement (SI units), and safety procedures. Students should also design
data tables and draw conclusions using mathematical computations and/or graphical analysis. The
recommendation is that students should actively engage in inquiry activities, laboratory experiences, and
scientific research (projects) for a minimum of 30% of class time.
The standards and performance objectives do not have to be taught in the order presented in this

                                                     Botany
BOT.1 Plant Morphology, Cell Structure, and Function
Conceptual Understanding: Plants are a diverse and important part of the biosphere, providing oxygen,
food, and shelter required for other organisms. The diversity of the plant kingdom is characterized by
unique traits that are observed to identify the various plant divisions.
BOT.1          Students will investigate the morphology, anatomy, and physiology of plants.
BOT.1.1        Analyze models (3-D, paper, and/or computer-based) to distinguish the basic morphology of the
               plant kingdom, with attention to structures and their related functions. Use cladograms or
               phylogenetic trees to identify evolutionary features that distinguish the plant kingdom from
               other kingdoms.
BOT.1.2        Using microscopes, observe, identify, record, and analyze (e.g., see and draw) cells and cell
               structures unique to plants. Use data measurements obtained from microscopy to compare the
               plant cells and organelle sizes between various examples (e.g., elodea, onion, or algae).
BOT.1.3        Describe the relationship between the structure and purpose of plant organs (e.g., roots, stems,
               and leaves).

BOT.1.8     Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to manipulate a variable of choice to refine a
            protocol to optimize output of photosynthesis or cellular respiration.*
BOT.1.9     Communicate the importance of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and nitrogen cycles to
            plant physiology through graphics such as poster or computer presentations.

            including leaf number, structure, and arrangement; root modifications; and flower structure
            and arrangement. Produce a visual product (e.g., an electronic presentation) to identify and
            communicate patterns of similarity and differences between the lab specimens.
BOT.1.11    Compare and contrast functions of the various characteristics found in plant divisions and utilize
            dichotomous keys to identify plant species.
                                                  Botany
BOT.2 Plant Evolution
Conceptual Understanding: Plants have been naturally selected to survive in a variety of habitats, from
aquatic to arboreal. The development of these characteristics is used to construct cladograms that illustrate
the evolution of plants.
BOT.2       Students will identify evolutionary modifications necessary for the terrestrial survival
            of plants.
BOT.2.1     Summarize and justify the characteristics of nonvascular algae (blue-green and green algae)
            and bryophytes that provide evidence of evolution within the plant kingdom.
BOT.2.2     Referencing the USDA plants database, identify, compare, and contrast seedless, naked seed,

            success as terrestrial plants.
BOT.2.4     Research information to develop, produce, and communicate a scientifically justifiable
            argument for the rapid amplification and success of angiosperm compared to other plant
            divisions.
BOT.2.5     Enrichment: Referencing the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s gene/protein
            databases, propose and design a scientifically supportable cladogram or phylogenetic tree that
            illustrates the evolutionary modifications of the plant kingdom using genetic (DNA) or protein
            sequence comparisons/alignments.
                                                  Botany
BOT.3 Plant Reproduction

            plants. Communicate the importance of these reproductive methods in regard to human food
            production.
BOT.3.2     Enrichment: Research and present an agronomically important crop (e.g., potato, sweet potato,
            pineapple, or strawberry) that is produced via vegetative propagation (non-GMOs) for human
            consumption. Include evidence-based arguments that identify the potential benefits and
            negative effects of this method of crop production.
BOT.3.3     Compare and contrast the consequences of the following reproductive methods: asexual
            reproduction, vegetative propagation, and sexual reproduction.
BOT.3.4     Plan and conduct comparative flower dissection to identify reproductive structures within the
            flower.
BOT.3.5     Compare the similarities between corresponding plant reproductive structures from a variety of
            species. Record via drawings of observed dissection specimens, and explain the similarities and
            differences observed.
BOT.3.6     Identify differences in flower structure and shape. Provide a rationale that explains the value of
            these differences in flower structure to reproductive success (e.g., pollinators, flower shape,
            smell, color, size, orientation).
BOT.3.7     Plan, conduct, and communicate the results of a comparative laboratory investigation of
            differing fruit types.
BOT.3.8     Using laboratory data, correctly categorize fruits, vegetables, nuts, modified stems, or other
            plant parts. Compare the scientific definitions of these terms to those used by the general
            public/society and the USDA to categorize food.
                                                   Botany
BOT.4 Society’s Reliance on Plants
Conceptual Understanding: Human reliance on plants and plant products began with food and building
materials. This use has expanded to include medicine, industrial clean up (phytoremediation) of human-
generated byproducts and toxic waste, and plant examples used in biomimicry for solving human problems.
BOT.4       Students will explore the global value of plants and the interaction between humans
            and plants.
BOT.4.1     Identify plants used in the bioremediation of an area due to natural processes (e.g., fire),
            industrial pollution, or wars, and develop and communicate a plan to remediate a habitat
            impacted by human interactions (e.g., carbon sinks, phytoremediation, or heavy metal
            detoxification).

BOT.5 Plant Adaptations to Varying Habitats
Conceptual Understanding: Before animal life forms can survive within a habitat, there must be an existing
plant population. Plants have specific adaptations that allow them to survive in habitats.
BOT.5       Students will explore adaptations that allow plants to survive in various habitats.
BOT.5.1     Research plants found in various habitats. Analyze how plants use adaptations for survival in
            these habitats including extreme habitats.
BOT.5.2     Relate atmospheric factors to biodiversity (e.g., climate as determined by temperature and
            precipitation).
BOT.5.3     Construct a model using technology that illustrates the levels of succession within a habitat
            (e.g., graveyard exploration, forest fire area, or reclamation sites).
BOT.5.4     Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to design and build a plant model based on
            extreme environment criteria to overcome the difficulties presented by this environment.

ecosystem. The ability to identify the plants within an ecosystem is a skill that will benefit students
throughout life.
BOT.6       Students will ask questions, plan, and conduct field investigations on local plant
            communities.
BOT.6.1     Conduct transects/plot studies to determine species, biodiversity, or health of a plant
            community. (Plots may be linear or a quadrat (square or circular) depending on the habitat.
            (Typically, relative density, relative dominance, and relative frequency of each species are
            calculated to infer an importance value of the species in the plot.)
BOT.6.2     Compare and contrast genomes using plant genetic databases (e.g., BLAST or plant GDB).
BOT.6.3     Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to define a problem, design, construct, evaluate,
            and improve a societal concern with the aid of plants (e.g., irrigation, water conservation, urban
            shading, green-space development, food deserts, or other local needs or issues).*

Chemistry, a one-credit course, is an elective and should be a rigorous course to prepare students for
careers in science, technology, engineering, integrated STEM activities, and mathematics. Chemistry
explores empirical concepts central to all areas of science. These concepts should be explored in-depth
using both quantitative and qualitative analysis, computational and experimental rigor, and the use of
inquiry-based methods of teaching. To accomplish a level of sophistication and depth, chemistry teachers
should extend concepts mastered by students in earlier grades. Cornerstone objectives of chemistry that
must be addressed and readdressed throughout the course are dimensional analysis, naming compounds,
balancing equations, and stoichiometry. To be successful in Chemistry, it is recommended that students
have completed Algebra I (Integrated Math I), and be enrolled in an upper level math course.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate
explanations about the natural world to increase the depth of understanding based on evidence, logic, and
innovation. These concepts are expected to appear throughout the course. As a laboratory-based course,
students are expected to utilize the science and engineering practices to design and conduct investigations

                                    EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
The Earth and space science course, a one-credit course, provides opportunities for students to continue to
develop and communicate a basic understanding of the Earth and its place in the universe through lab-
based activities, integrated STEM activities, inquiry, mathematical expressions, and concept exploration.
The Earth and space science course will help students apply scientific concepts in natural settings and guide
them to become responsible stewards of Earth’s natural resources.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate
explanations about the natural world to increase depth of understanding based on evidence, logic, and
innovation. These concepts are expected to appear throughout the course. As a lab-based course, students
are expected to design and conduct investigations using appropriate equipment, measurement, and safety
procedures. The recommendation is that students should be actively engaged in inquiry activities, lab
experiences, and scientific research for a minimum of 30% of the class time.
Although the standards and performance objectives do not have to be taught in the order presented in this
document, they are arranged from the universe, through the solar system, the interacting systems of planet
Earth, and the interrelationships between our planet and humans throughout time. The performance
objectives are intentionally broad to allow school districts and teachers the flexibility to create a curriculum
that meets the needs of their students.
Objectives identified by “Enrichment:” are considered enrichment material that may be expanded upon as
time permits. Engineering standards are represented in some performance objectives with specific wording
that will prompt students to approach learning and exploration using the engineering process. These
performance objectives are marked with an * at the end of the statement.

             activities.
ESS.4.1      Research, evaluate, and communicate about how human life on Earth shapes Earth’s systems
             and responds to the interaction of Earth’s systems (e.g., geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere,
             and biosphere). Examine how geochemical and ecological processes interact through time to
             cycle matter and energy and how human activity alters the rates of these processes.
ESS.4.2      Research, assess, and communicate how Earth’s systems influence the distribution of life,
             including how various natural hazards and geologic events (e.g., volcanic eruptions,

                                       ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
Environmental science, a one-half credit course, is a laboratory- or field-based course that explores ways in
which the environment shapes living communities. Human sustainability and environmental balance are
emphasized. Laboratory activities, research, the use of technology, and the effective communication of
results through various methods are integral components of this course, which also emphasizes a student-
centered and collaborative classroom environment.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate
explanations about the natural world that increase the depth of understanding based on evidence, logic,
and innovation. These concepts are expected to appear throughout the course. As a laboratory-based
course, students are expected to utilize the science and engineering practices to design and conduct
investigations using appropriate equipment, measurement (SI units), and safety procedures. Students
should also design data tables and draw conclusions using mathematical computations and/or graphical
analysis. The recommendation is that students should be actively engaged in inquiry activities, laboratory
experiences, and scientific research (projects) for a minimum of 30% of class time.
The standards and performance objectives do not have to be taught in the order presented in this
document. The performance objectives are intentionally broad to allow school districts and teachers the
flexibility to create a curriculum that meets the needs of their students.
Objectives identified by “Enrichment:” are considered enrichment material that may be expanded upon as
time permits. Engineering standards are represented in some performance objectives with specific wording
that will prompt students to approach learning and exploration using the engineering process. These
performance objectives are marked with an * at the end of the statement.

ENV.1 Biosphere and Biodiversity
Conceptual Understanding: The biosphere is a system of biomes, each with unique characteristics. These
characteristics are classified as biotic or abiotic. The environment in which humans live is dependent on a
system of cycles. These biogeochemical cycles are the water, nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus cycles. The
flow of energy within the environment is critical for the success of life. The biodiversity within a biome is
fragile and easily affected by human actions. Plant and animal populations are dynamic and are
demonstrated through graphical analysis.
ENV.1          Students will investigate the interdependence of diverse living organisms and their
               interactions with the components of the biosphere.
ENV.1.1        Identify, investigate, and evaluate the interactions of the abiotic and biotic factors that
               determine the types of organisms that live in major biomes.
ENV.1.2        Evaluate evidence in nonfiction text to explain how biological or physical changes within biomes
               affect populations and communities and how changing conditions may result in altered
               ecosystems.
ENV.1.3        Use models to explain why the flow of energy through an ecosystem can be illustrated by a
               pyramid with less energy available at the higher trophic levels compared to lower levels.

           evolutionary (e.g., predator-prey, cooperation, competition, and mimicry) relationships within
           specific environments.
ENV.1.5    Develop and use models to diagram the flow of nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus through the
           environment.
ENV.1.6    Use mathematics, graphics, and informational text to determine how population density-
           dependent and density-independent limiting factors affect populations and diversity within
           ecosystems. Use technology to illustrate and compare a variety of population-growth curves.
ENV.1.7    Analyze and interpret quantitative data to construct explanations of how the carrying capacity
           of an ecosystem may change as the availability of resources changes.
ENV.1.8    Utilize data to communicate changes within a given population and the environmental factors
           that may have impacted these changes (e.g., weather patterns, natural disasters)
ENV.1.9    Evaluate and communicate data that explains how human activity may impact biodiversity
           (e.g., introduction, removal, and reintroduction of an organism within an ecosystem; land
           usage) and genetic variations of organisms, including endangered and threatened species.
ENV.1.10   Enrichment: Engage in scientific argument from evidence the benefits versus harm of
           genetically modified organisms.

ENV.2 Natural Resources Use and Conservation
Conceptual Understanding: The environment is affected by human demand for its resources. However,
through conservation applications, a balance may be reached between human sustainability and the
environment.
ENV.2      Students will relate the impact of human activities on the environment, conservation
           activities, and efforts to maintain and restore ecosystems.
ENV.2.1    Differentiate between renewable and nonrenewable resources, and compare and contrast the
           pros and cons of using these resources.
ENV.2.2    Investigate and research the pros and cons of using traditional sources of energy (e.g., fossil
           fuels) and alternative sources of energy (e.g., water, wind, geothermal, biomass/biofuels, solar).
ENV.2.3    Compare and contrast biodegradable and nonbiodegradable wastes and their significance in
           landfills.
ENV.2.4    Examine solutions for developing, conserving, managing, recycling, and reusing energy and
           mineral resources to minimize impacts in natural systems (e.g., agricultural soil use, mining for
           coal, construction sites, and exploration of petroleum and natural gas sources).

           Surf Your Watershed, MDEQ publications) and communicate the possible effects on the
           environment and human health.
ENV.2.6    Enrichment: Obtain water from a local source (e.g., stream on campus, rainwater, ditch water)
           to monitor water quality over time, using a spreadsheet program to graphically represent
           collected data.

ENV.3 Human Activities and Climate Change
Conceptual Understanding: Humans are a part of their environment and may have a detrimental impact on
the environment. Using evidence based on scientific research, efforts are underway to repair the
environment. Historical and current regional and global models illustrate the changes in the environment.
ENV.3         Students will discuss the direct and indirect impacts of certain types of human
              activities on the Earth’s climate.
ENV.3.1       Use a model to describe cycling of carbon through the ocean, atmosphere, soil, and biosphere
              and how increases in carbon dioxide concentrations have resulted in atmospheric and climate
              changes.
ENV.3.2       Interpret data and climate models to predict how global and regional climate change can affect
              Earth’s systems (e.g., precipitation, temperature, impacts on sea level, global ice volumes, and
              atmosphere and ocean composition).
ENV.3.3       Use satellite imagery and other resources to analyze changes in biomes over time (e.g., glacial
              retreat, deforestation, desertification) and propose strategies to reduce the impact of human
              activities leading to these issues.
ENV.3.4       Enrichment: Determine mathematically an individual’s impact on the environment (carbon
              footprint, water usage, landfill contribution) and develop a plan to reduce personal
              contribution.
                                         Environmental Science
ENV.4 Human Sustainability
Conceptual Understanding: Human health is dependent on the environment. Changes within an
environment, whether natural or man-made, may lead to the spread of disease. Sudden environmental
changes (e.g., tsunami or volcanic activity) lead to human migration into other areas of the environment.
Case studies illustrate the need to intervene in environmental change, when possible, to improve health
issues (e.g., smog’s effect on asthma patients).
ENV.4         Students will demonstrate an understanding of the interdependence of human
              sustainability and the environment.
ENV.4.1       Identify human impact and develop a solution for protection of the atmosphere, considering
              pollutants (e.g., acid rain, air pollution, smog, ozone layer, or increased levels of greenhouse
              gases) and the impacts of pollutants on human health (e.g., asthma, COPD, emphysema, and
              cancer).
ENV.4.2       Evaluate data and other information to explain how key natural resources (e.g., water sources,
              fertile soils, concentrations of minerals, and fossil fuels), natural hazards, and climate changes
              influence human activity (e.g., mass migrations, human health).
ENV.4.3       Enrichment: Research and analyze case studies to determine the impact of human-related and
              natural environmental changes on human health and communicate possible solutions to
              reduce/resolve the dilemma.
ENV.4.4       Enrichment: Explore online resources related to air pollution to determine air quality in a
              geographic area and communicate the possible effects on the environment and human health.

ENV.4.5     Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to define a problem, design, construct, evaluate,
            and improve a device or method to reduce or prevent human impact on a natural resource (e.g.,
            build a water filter, design an air purifier, develop a method to prevent parking lot pollution
            from entering a watershed).*

FB.1 History of Biology and Impacts on Society
 Conceptual Understanding: The history of science is a compilation of the works of many people. To
 understand science and its applications, the history of scientific experiments and developments must be
 understood. The needs of society have been the driving force behind numerous advances in science and
 technology. Advances in science and technology have forever changed, and will continue to change,
 society.

             alternative energy development, and/or biomimicry.
                                          Foundations of Biology
FB.2 The Chemistry of Life
 Conceptual Understanding: Living and non-living things are composed of elements. Elements have the
 unique ability to form compounds and molecules based on their atomic structures. Water has unique
 properties that allow it to form solutions with a variety of compounds. Living organisms are composed of
 biological molecules that interact with water and through chemical reactions, help to maintain
 homeostasis.
 FB.2        Students will demonstrate an understanding of the structure and interactions of
             matter and how the organization of matter supports living organisms.

             mass, and group or family) to describe the organization of the periodic table.
 FB.2.3      Relate chemical reactivity to an element’s position on the periodic table. Use this information to
             determine what type of bond will form between elements (ionic, covalent, hydrogen).
 FB.2.4      Analyze and interpret data to classify common solutions as acids, bases, or neutral.
             Communicate the importance of pH in living systems.
 FB.2.5      Investigate how the properties of water (e.g., cohesion, adhesion, heat capacity, solvent
             properties) contribute to the maintenance of living cells and organisms.
 FB.2.6      Explain the role of the major biomolecules (carbohydrates, proteins -including enzymes, lipids,
             and nucleic acids) to the survival of living organisms.

             of biomolecules to their function in living things (discuss types bonding, importance of the
             strength and weakness of the bond in function, energy in bonds, enzyme function).
                                          Foundations of Biology
FB.3 Organization and Energy in Living Systems
 Conceptual Understanding: Cells are the basic unit of any living organism. All organisms are composed of
 one (unicellular) or many cells (multicellular). Living things use their cells to acquire energy from their
 environment to grow and reproduce, and then they respond and adapt to that environment for survival.
 FB.3        Students will demonstrate an understanding of how the structure of living organisms
             supports the essential functions of life.
 FB.3.1      Compare and contrast prokaryotic/eukaryotic and plant/animal/bacteria cells.

 FB.3.2       Use models to investigate and explain structures within living cells that support life (e.g.,
              cytoplasm, cell membrane, cell wall, nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, Golgi,
              vacuoles, ER, ribosomes, chromosomes, centrioles, cytoskeleton, nucleolus, nuclear membrane).
 FB.3.3       Compare and contrast active and passive cellular transport. Analyze the movement of water
              across a cell membrane in hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic solutions.

              inorganic phosphate.
 FB.3.6       Compare and contrast the processes and results of mitosis and meiosis.
 FB.3.7       Enrichment: Research and orally communicate the possible outcomes of a failure of mitosis
              (cancer) or meiosis (nondisjunction).
                                          Foundations of Biology
FB.4 Molecular Basis of Heredity
 Conceptual Understanding: One strand of DNA creates a chromosome. Chromosomes have genes, which
 are simply segments of DNA. The information stored in DNA (in genes on chromosomes) determines the
 unique characteristics of an individual. DNA is the blueprint for RNA through transcription, which in turn,
 allows for the creation of a protein through translation. Modern technologies allow humans to manipulate
 DNA, RNA, and proteins to solve human dilemmas. Using technology to manipulate genetic information is
 controversial.
 FB.4         Students will demonstrate an understanding of how genetic information is
              transferred from parent to offspring.
 FB.4.1       Compare and contrast the basic structure and function of nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA).
 FB.4.2       Obtain and communicate information illustrating the relationships among DNA, genes,
              chromosomes, and proteins to the basis of life.
 FB.4.3       Use models (e.g., Punnett squares) and mathematical reasoning to describe and predict
              patterns of inheritance of single genetic traits from parents to offspring (e.g., dominant, and
              recessive traits, incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, sex- linkage).
 FB.4.4       Obtain and communicate information to describe how mutations may affect genetic expression
              and provide examples.
 FB.4.5       Research and report genetic technologies that may improve the quality of life (e.g., genetic
              engineering, cloning, gene splicing, DNA testing).
 FB.4.6       Enrichment: Debate the pros and cons of using biotechnology to manipulate genetic
              information for human purpose (society).
                                          Foundations of Biology
FB.5 Biological Evolution
 Conceptual Understanding: The geologic time scale interpreted from rock strata and fossil evidence
 provides a way to organize major historical events in Earth’s history. Rock strata can document the
 existence, diversity, extinction, and changes in many life forms. Adaptation by natural selection acting over
 generations is one important process by which species gradually change to respond to environmental
 pressures.

 FB.5         Students will demonstrate an understanding of Earth’s fossil record and its indication
              of the diversity of life over time.
 FB.5.1       Investigate through research the contributions of scientists to the theory of evolution and
              evolutionary processes (e.g., Needham, Spallanzani, Redi, Pasteur, Lyell, Lamarck, Malthus,
              Wallace, Darwin).
 FB.5.2       Analyze and interpret data to support claims that different types of fossils provide evidence of
              the diversity of life that has existed on Earth and of the relationships between past and existing
              life on Earth.
 FB.5.3       Obtain and communicate information to explain how DNA evidence and fossil records support
              Darwin’s theory of evolution.
 FB.5.4       Investigate how biological adaptations and genetic variations of traits in a population enhance
              the probability of survival in an environment (natural selection).
 FB.5.5       Enrichment: Create and analyze models that illustrate the relatedness between all living things
              (cladograms/phylogenic trees).
                                            Foundations of Biology
FB.6 Ecological Principals
 Conceptual Understanding: Ecosystems are dynamic in nature, full of complex interactions that affect the
 numbers and types of organisms that can survive. Biotic and abiotic factors affect ecosystems, allowing for
 them to sustain only a limited number of organisms and populations, known as a carrying capacity. There is
 a delicate balance that exists between the living and non-living things in an ecosystem. Humans can
 interrupt this balance, causing both local and global environmental issues.
 FB.6         Students will understand the interdependence of living organisms and their
              environment.
 FB 6.1       Compare and contrast biotic and abiotic factors.
 FB 6.2       Use models to analyze the cycling of matter in an ecosystem (e.g., water, carbon
              dioxide/oxygen, nitrogen).
 FB.6.3       Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information to explain relationships that exist between
              abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem. Explain how changes in biotic and abiotic
              components affect the balance of an ecosystem over time.
 FB 6.4       Develop and use models to discuss the climate, flora, and fauna of the terrestrial and aquatic
              biomes of the world.
 FB 6.5       Use models to analyze the flow of energy through food chains, webs, and pyramids.
 FB 6.6       Engage in scientific argument from evidence to distinguish organisms that exist in symbiotic
              (mutualism, parasitism, commensalism) or co-evolutionary (predator-prey, cooperation,
              competition, and mimicry) relationships within ecosystems.
 FB 6.7       Enrichment: Design solutions to reduce the impact of human activity on the ecosystem.

Conceptual Understanding: Scientists evaluate multiple explanations for the same phenomena to
determine their differences, similarities, strengths, and weaknesses, and evaluating the validity of
conclusions based on experimental results. They evaluate the validity of conclusions based on experimental
results. Students should analyze scientific investigations and data presented in passages like those found in
the science section of the ACT (e.g., Data Representation, Research Summaries, and Conflicting Viewpoint
passages) to evaluate scientific explanations.
FSL.3D        Students will apply scientific literacy and thinking skills to evaluate theoretical

Genetics, a one-half credit course, is a laboratory-based course that explores the principles of classical and
molecular genetics. The structure and function relationship of DNA forms the foundation for the study of
DNA inheritance, RNA and protein production, and the resulting phenotypes in organisms. Classical
Mendelian genetics is explored to analyze patterns of inheritance and genetic variability within populations.
Multiple applications of biotechnology are investigated to address a variety of problems in modern society.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate

GEN.1 Structure and Function of DNA
Conceptual Understanding: Chromosomes, the carriers of genetic information, are composed of both DNA
and proteins. A significant body of evidence generated through multiple experiments by many scientists led
to the conclusion that DNA is the universal genetic material. Once this was established, efforts focused on
deciphering the structure of DNA and the mechanism through which DNA is passed on to cells with little to
no errors. These discoveries formed the foundation of modern molecular genetics.
GEN.1A         Students will demonstrate that all cells contain genetic material in the form of DNA.
GEN.1A.1 Model the biochemical structure, either 3-D or computer-based, of DNA based on the
               experimental evidence available to Watson and Crick (Chargaff, 1950; Franklin, 1951).
GEN.1A.2 Explain the importance of the historical experiments that determined that DNA is the heritable
               material of the cell (Griffith, 1928; Avery, McCarty & MacLeod, 1944; Hershey & Chase, 1952).
GEN.1A.3 Relate the structure of DNA to its specific functions within the cell.
GEN.1A.4 Conduct a standard DNA extraction protocol using salt, detergent, and ethanol from various cell
               types (e.g., plant, animal, fungus). Compare and contrast the consistency and quantity of DNA
               extracted from various cell types.
GEN.1A.5 Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to refine the methodology to optimize the DNA-
               extraction process for various cell types.*

Conceptual Understanding: Before a cell divides, the DNA sequence of its chromosomes is replicated, and
each daughter cell receives a copy. In multicellular organisms, individual cells grow and then divide via a
process called mitosis, thereby allowing the organism to grow.
GEN.1B       Students will analyze how the DNA sequence is copied and transmitted to new cells.
GEN.1B.1     Compare and contrast various proposed models of DNA replication (i.e., conservative, semi-
             conservative, and disruptive). Evaluate the evidence used to determine the mechanism of DNA
             replication.
GEN.1B.2     Develop and use models to illustrate the mechanics of DNA replication.
GEN.1B.3     Microscopically observe and analyze the stages of the cell cycle (G1-S-G2-M) to describe the
             phenomenon, and identify methods at different cell cycle checkpoints through which the
             integrity of the DNA code is maintained.

GEN.2 Transcription, Translation, and Mutations
Conceptual Understanding: The genetic information stored in the DNA molecule is expressed to produce a
protein and result in the formation of an observable trait, or phenotype, in the organism. Gene expression
leads to protein production through the processes of transcription in the nucleus and translation in the
ribosome.
GEN.2A       Students will analyze and explain the processes of transcription and translation in
             protein production.
GEN.2A.1. Compare and contrast the structure of RNA to DNA and relate this structure to the different
             function of each molecule.
GEN.2A.2 Describe and model how the process of transcription produces RNA from a DNA template in
             both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
GEN.2A.3 Develop a model to show the relationship between the components involved in the mechanics of
             translation at the ribosome.

             rRNA, mRNA, and snRNA.
GEN.2A.5 Enrichment: Evaluate Beadle and Tatum’s “One Gene-One Enzyme Hypothesis” (1941) in the
             development of the central dogma (DNA →RNA →Protein). Explain how new discoveries, such
             as alternate splicing of introns, have led to the revision of the central dogma.
Conceptual Understanding: Mutations may result in the formation of new gene alleles, alter protein
structure, and produce new phenotypes.
GEN.2B       Students will determine the causes and effects of mutations in DNA.
GEN.2B.1     Identify factors that cause mutations (e.g., environmental, errors in replication, and viral
             infections).
GEN.2B.2     Explain how these mutations may result in changes in protein structure and function.
GEN.2B.3     Describe cellular mechanisms that can help to minimize mutations (e.g., cell cycle checkpoints,
             DNA polymerase proofreading, and DNA repair enzymes).
GEN.2B.4     Investigate the role of mutations and the loss of cell cycle regulation in the development of
             cancers.

               technology and personalized medicine, then propose and test targeted medical or forensic
               applications.*
                                                     Genetics
GEN.3 Biotechnological Applications
Conceptual Understanding: The application of modern molecular genetics led to the development of
recombinant DNA technology and the subsequent explosion of biotechnology applications. Biotechnology
and the use of genetically modified organisms have altered many aspects of daily life, including forensics,
agriculture, and medicine.
GEN.3          Students will investigate biotechnology applications and bioengineering practices.
GEN.3.1        Explain and demonstrate the use of various tools and techniques of DNA manipulation and their
               applications in forensics (e.g., paternity and victim/suspect identification), agriculture (e.g.,
               pesticide or herbicide resistance, improved yields, and improved nutritional value), and
               personalized medicine (e.g., targeted therapies, cancer treatment, production of insulin and
               human growth hormone, and engineering insect vectors of human parasites).
GEN.3.2        Experimentally demonstrate genetic transformation, protein purification, and/or gel
               electrophoresis.
GEN.3.3        Enrichment: Use an engineering design process to refine methodology and optimize the process
               of genetic transformation, protein purification, and/or gel electrophoresis.*
GEN.3.4        Enrichment: Develop logical arguments based on scientific evidence for and against ethical
               concerns regarding biotechnology/bioengineering.
                                                     Genetics
GEN.4 Classic Mendelian Genetics
Conceptual Understanding: Gregor Mendel is known as the “Father of Genetics” due to his work with pea
plants, which established that traits are passed from parents to offspring in predictable ways. Mendel’s
findings formed the foundation from which geneticists can determine the mode of inheritance of various
traits (e.g., dominant, recessive, and codominant).
GEN.4          Students will analyze and interpret data collected from probability calculations to
               explain the inheritance of traits within a population.
GEN.4.1        Demonstrate Mendel’s law of dominance and segregation using mathematics to predict
               phenotypic and genotypic ratios.
GEN.4.2        Illustrate Mendel’s law of independent assortment by analyzing multi-trait cross data sets for
               patterns and trends.
GEN.4.3        Investigate traits that follow non-Mendelian inheritance patterns (e.g., incomplete dominance,
               codominance, multiple alleles, autosomal linkage, sex-linkage, polygenic, and epistasis).
GEN.4.4        Construct pedigrees from observed phenotypes. Analyze and interpret data to determine
               patterns of inheritance and disease risk.
GEN.4.5        Enrichment: Construct maps of genes on a chromosome based on data obtained from 2- and/or
               3- point crosses or from recombination frequencies.

GEN.5 Population Genetics
Conceptual Understanding: Most species display considerable amounts of genetic variation. The variation
is represented as differences in allele frequencies within the gene pool of populations of a species.
Variations in the structure of gene pools form the basis of evolutionary change.
GEN.5         Students will apply population genetic concepts to explain variability of organisms
              within a population.
GEN.5.1       Model the inheritance of chromosomes through meiotic cell division and demonstrate how
              meiosis and sexual reproduction lead to genetic variation in populations.
GEN.5.2       Explain how natural selection acts upon genetic variability within a population and may lead to
              changes in allelic frequencies over time and evolutionary changes in populations.
GEN.5.3       Describe processes that cause changes in allelic frequencies (e.g., nonrandom mating, small

                             HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
Human Anatomy and Physiology, a one-credit course, is a laboratory-based course that investigates the
structures and functions of the human body. Core content emphasizes the structure and function of cells,
tissues, and organs; organization of the human body and its biochemical composition; the skeletal,
muscular, nervous, endocrine, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular, integumentary, immune, urinary, and
reproductive systems; and the impact of diseases on certain systems. Laboratory activities, research, the
use of technology, and the effective communication of results through various methods are integral
components of this course. It is recommended that Human Anatomy and Physiology be taken after
successful completion of Biology.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate
explanations about the natural world to increase the depth of understanding based on evidence, logic, and
innovation. These concepts are expected to appear throughout the course. As a laboratory-based course,
students are expected to design and conduct investigations using appropriate equipment, measurement (SI
units), and safety procedures. Students should also design data tables and draw conclusions using
mathematical computations and/or graphical analysis. It is recommended that students should be actively
engaged in inquiry activities, lab experiences, and scientific research (projects) for a minimum of 30% of the
class time.
The standards and performance objectives do not have to be taught in the order presented in this
document. The performance objectives are intentionally broad to allow school districts and teachers the
flexibility to create a curriculum that meets the needs of their students.
Objectives identified by “Enrichment:” are considered enrichment material that may be expanded upon as
time permits. Engineering standards are represented in some performance objectives with specific wording
that will prompt students to approach learning and exploration using the engineering process. These
performance objectives are marked with an * at the end of the statement.

                                                     PHYSICS
Physics, a one-credit course, provides opportunities for students to develop and communicate an
understanding of matter and energy through lab-based activities, integrated STEM activities, mathematical
expressions, and concept exploration. Concepts covered in this course include kinematics, dynamics,
energy, mechanical and electromagnetic waves, and electricity. Laboratory activities, uses of technology,
effective communication of results, and research of contemporary scientific theories through various
methods are integral components of this course. Science as inquiry is an integral part of the framework,
placing emphasis on developing the ability to ask questions, observe, experiment, measure, problem solve,
gather data, and communicate findings. Inquiry is not an isolated unit of instruction and must be embedded
throughout the content strands. All Physics laboratories need to be well equipped with the materials and
apparatuses necessary to allow students to have meaningful experiences in the laboratory. To be successful
in Physics, it is recommended that students have completed Algebra I. Geometry, and Algebra II (Integrated
Math I, II, II), and be enrolled in an upper level math course.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate
explanations about the natural world to increase the depth of understanding based on evidence, logic, and
innovation. These concepts are expected to appear throughout the course. As a laboratory-based course,
students are expected to utilize the science and engineering practices to design and conduct investigations
using appropriate equipment, measurement (SI units), and safety procedures. Students should also design
data tables and draw conclusions using mathematical computations and/or graphical analysis. It is
recommended that students should actively engage in inquiry activities, laboratory experiences, and
scientific research (projects) for a minimum of 30% of class time.
The standards and performance objectives do not have to be taught in the order presented in this
document. The performance objectives are intentionally broad to allow school districts and teachers the
flexibility to create a curriculum that meets the needs of their students.
Objectives identified by “Enrichment:” are considered enrichment material that may be expanded upon as
time permits. Engineering standards are represented in some performance objectives with specific wording
that will prompt students to approach learning and exploration using the engineering process. These
performance objectives are marked with an * at the end of the statement.

that survey the nine major phyla of the Kingdom Animalia. Morphology, taxonomy, anatomy, and
physiology are investigated. Comparative studies are addressed during laboratory observations and
dissections. Laboratory activities, research, the use of technology, and the effective communication of
results through various methods are integral components of this course. It is recommended that Zoology I
and/or Zoology II be taken after the successful completion of Biology.
NOTE: Students do not have to complete Zoology I before enrolling in Zoology II. The disciplinary core idea
ZOO.1, Evolution, does not have to be repeated in Zoology II if students have successfully completed
Zoology I and are continuing study with Zoology II.
The nature of science refers to the foundational concepts that govern the way scientists formulate
explanations about the natural world that increase the depth of understanding based on evidence, logic,
and innovation. These concepts are expected to appear throughout the course. As a lab-based course,
students are expected to design and conduct investigations using appropriate equipment, measurement (SI
units), and safety procedures. Students should also design data tables and draw conclusions using
mathematical computations and/or graphical analysis. It is recommended that students should be actively
engaged in inquiry activities, lab experiences, and scientific research (projects) for a minimum of 30% of the
class time.
The standards and performance objectives do not have to be taught in the order presented in this
document. The performance objectives are intentionally broad to allow school districts and teachers the
flexibility to create a curriculum that meets the needs of their students.
Objectives identified by “Enrichment:” are considered enrichment material that may be expanded upon as
time permits. Engineering standards are represented in some performance objectives with specific wording
that will prompt students to approach learning and exploration using the engineering process. These
performance objectives are marked with an * at the end of the statement.
                                                       Zoology I
ZOO.1 Evolution
Conceptual Understanding: Evolution results from the interaction of four factors: (1) the potential for a
species to increase in number, (2) genetic variation occurring within a species due to mutations and sexual
reproduction, (3) limited supply of resources needed for survival resulting in competition, and (4) those
organisms that are better adapted for an environment survive and reproduce. Genetic information provides
evidence of evolution. DNA sequences vary among species, but some similarities remain. By comparing the
DNA sequences of different organisms, multiple lines of descent may be inferred. The ongoing branching
into multiple lines of descent may also be derived by comparing the amino acid sequences and by
examining the anatomical and embryological evidence.
ZOO.1          Students will develop a model of evolutionary change over time.
