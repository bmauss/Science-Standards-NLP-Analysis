Students who demonstrate understanding can:
PS1-K-1.        Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on the
motion of an object.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of pushes or pulls could include a string attached to an object being pulled, a person pushing an object, a
      person stopping a rolling ball, and two objects colliding and pushing on each other.
 • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to different relative strengths or different directions, but not both at the same time. Assessment does not
      include non-contact pushes or pulls such as those produced by magnets.
PS1-K-2.        Analyze data to determine if a design solution works as intended to change the speed or direction of an object with a push or a
pull.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of problems requiring a solution could include having a marble or other object move a certain distance, follow
      a particular path, and knock down other objects. Examples of solutions could include tools such as a ramp to increase the speed of the object
      and a structure that would cause an object such as a marble or ball to turn.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include friction as a mechanism for change in speed.
                                                                   Supporting Content
PS2.A: Forces and Motion
 • Pushes and pulls can have different strengths and directions. (PS1-K-1, PS1-K-2)
 • Pushing or pulling on an object can change the speed or direction of its motion and can start or stop it. (PS1-K-1, PS1-K-2)

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
ESS1-K-1.        Use and share observations of local weather conditions to describe patterns over time, which includes the 4 seasons.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of qualitative observations could include descriptions of the weather (such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, and warm);
     examples of quantitative observations could include numbers of sunny, windy, and rainy days in a month. Examples of patterns could include
     that it is usually cooler in the morning than in the afternoon and the number of sunny days versus cloudy days in different months.
 • Content Limit: Assessment of quantitative observations limited to whole numbers and relative measures such as warmer/cooler.
ESS1-K-2.        Construct an argument supported by evidence for how plants and animals (including humans) can change the environment to
meet their needs.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of plants and animals changing their environment could include a squirrel digs in the ground to hide its food

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
ESS2-K-1.      Use a model to represent the relationship between the needs of different plants and animals (including humans) and the places
they live.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of relationships could include that deer eat buds and leaves, therefore, they usually live in forested areas; and,
     grasses need sunlight so they often grow in meadows. Plants, animals, and their surroundings make up a system.
ESS2-K-2.      Ask questions to obtain information about the purpose of weather forecasting to prepare for, and respond to, severe weather.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on local forms of severe weather.
ESS2-K-3.      Communicate solutions that will reduce the impact of humans on the land, water, air, and/or other living things in the local
environment.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of human impact on the land could include cutting trees to produce paper and using resources to produce
     bottles. Examples of solutions could include reusing paper and recycling cans and bottles.
                                                                Supporting Content
ESS3.A: Natural Resources
 • Living things need water, air, and resources from the land, and they live in places that have the things they need. Humans use natural
     resources for everything they do. (ESS2-K-1)
ESS3.B: Natural Hazards
 • Some kinds of severe weather are more likely than others in a given region. Weather scientists forecast severe weather so that the
     communities can prepare for and respond to these events. (ESS2-K-2)
ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems
 • Things that people do to live comfortably can affect the world around them. But they can make choices that reduce their impacts on the land,
     water, air, and other living things. (ESS2-K-3)
ETS1.A: Defining and Delimiting an Engineering Problem
 • Asking questions, making observations, and gathering information are helpful in thinking about problems. (ESS2-K-2)

                                                                Performance Standards
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
PS1-1-1.          Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrating materials can make sound and that sound can make materials
vibrate.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of vibrating materials that make sound could include tuning forks and plucking a stretched string. Examples of
      how sound can make matter vibrate could include holding a piece of paper near a speaker making sound and holding an object near a
      vibrating tuning fork.
PS1-1-2.          Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that objects in darkness can be seen only when illuminated.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of observations could include those made in a completely dark room, a pinhole box, and a video of a cave
      explorer with a flashlight. Illumination could be from an external light source or by an object giving off its own light.
PS1-1-3.          Plan and conduct investigations to determine the effect of placing objects made with different materials in the path of a beam of
light.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of materials could include those that are transparent (such as clear plastic), translucent (such as wax paper),
      opaque (such as cardboard), and reflective (such as a mirror).
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include the speed of light.
PS1-1-4.          Use tools and materials to design and build a device that uses light or sound to solve the problem of communicating over a
distance.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of devices could include a light source to send signals, paper cup and string “telephones,” and a pattern of
      drum beats.
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include technological details for how communication devices work.
                                                                  Supporting Content
PS4.A: Wave Properties
  • Sound can make matter vibrate, and vibrating matter can make sound. (PS1-1-1)
PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation (light)
  • Objects can be seen if light is available to illuminate them or if they give off their own light. (PS1-1-2)
  • Some materials allow light to pass through them, others allow only some light through and others block all the light and create a dark shadow
      on any surface beyond them, where the light cannot reach. Mirrors can be used to redirect a light beam. (Boundary: The idea that light travels
      from place to place is developed through experiences with light sources, mirrors, and shadows, but no attempt is made to discuss the speed
      of light.) (PS1-1-3)

PS2.A: Forces and Motion
 • Each force acts on one particular object and has both strength and a direction. An object at rest typically has multiple forces acting on it, but
     they add to give zero net force on the object. Forces that do not sum to zero can cause changes in the object’s speed or direction of motion.
     (Boundary: Qualitative and conceptual, but not quantitative additions of forces are used at this level.) (PS1-3-1)
 • Force applied to an object can alter the position and motion of that object: revolve, rotate, float, sink, fall and at rest.(PS1-3-2)
 • The patterns of an object’s motion in various situations can be observed and measured; when that past motion exhibits a regular pattern,
     future motion can be predicted from it. (Boundary: Technical terms, such as magnitude, velocity, momentum, and vector quantity, are not
     introduced at this level, but the concept that some quantities need both size and direction to be described is developed.) (PS1-3-2)
PS2.B: Types of Interactions
 • Objects in contact exert forces on each other. (PS1-3-1)
 • Electric and magnetic forces between a pair of objects do not require that the objects be in contact. The sizes of the forces in each situation
     depend on the properties of the objects and their distances apart and, for forces between two magnets, on their orientation relative to each
     other. (PS1-3-3, PS1-3-4)

PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer
 • Energy is present whenever there are moving objects, sound, light, or heat. When objects collide, energy can be transferred from one object
     to another, thereby changing their motion. In such collisions, some energy is typically also transferred to the surrounding air; as a result, the
     air gets heated and sound is produced. (PS1-4-2, PS1-4-3)
 • Light also transfers energy from place to place. (PS1-4-2)

LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems
 • The food of almost any kind of animal can be traced back to plants. Organisms are related in food webs in which some animals eat plants for
     food and other animals eat the animals that eat plants. Some organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, break down dead organisms (both plants
     or plants parts and animals) and therefore operate as “decomposers.” Decomposition eventually restores (recycles) some materials back to
     the soil. Organisms can survive only in environments in which their particular needs are met. A healthy ecosystem is one in which multiple
     species of different types are each able to meet their needs in a relatively stable web of life. Newly introduced species can damage the
     balance of an ecosystem. (LS2-4-1)
LS2.B: Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems
 • Matter cycles between the air and soil and among plants, animals, and microbes as these organisms live and die. Organisms obtain gases, and
     water, from the environment, and release waste matter (gas, liquid, or solid) back into the environment. (LS2-4-1)

ESS2.A: Earth Materials and Systems
 • Earth’s major systems are the geosphere (solid and molten rock, soil, and sediments), the hydrosphere (water and ice), the atmosphere (air),
      and the biosphere (living things, including humans). These systems interact in multiple ways to affect Earth’s surface materials and processes.
      The ocean supports a variety of ecosystems and organisms, shapes landforms, and influences climate. Winds and clouds in the atmosphere
      interact with the landforms to determine patterns of weather. (ESS2-5-1)
ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth’s Surface Processes
 • Nearly all of Earth’s available water is in the ocean. Most fresh water is in glaciers or underground; only a tiny fraction is in streams, lakes,
      wetlands, and the atmosphere. (ESS2-5-2)

 • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to the criteria of amount, time, and temperature of substance in testing the device.
                                                                 Supporting Content
PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter
 • Substances are made from different types of atoms, which combine with one another in various ways. Atoms form molecules that range in
     size from two to thousands of atoms. (PS1-MS-1)
 • Each pure substance has characteristic physical and chemical properties (for any bulk quantity under given conditions) that can be used to
     identify it. (PS1-MS-2, PS1-MS- 3)
 • Gases and liquids are made of molecules or inert atoms that are moving about relative to each other. (PS1-MS-4)
 • In a liquid, the molecules are constantly in contact with others; in a gas, they are widely spaced except when they happen to collide. In a solid,
     atoms are closely spaced and may vibrate in position but do not change relative locations. (PS1-MS- 4)
 • Solids may be formed from molecules, or they may be extended structures with repeating subunits (e.q., crystals). (PS1-MS-1)
 • The changes of state that occur with variations in temperature or pressure can be described and predicted using these models of matter.
     (PS1-MS-4)
PS1.B: Chemical Reactions
 • Substances react chemically in characteristic ways. In a chemical process, the atoms that make up the original substances are regrouped into
     different molecules, and these new substances have different properties from those of the reactants. (PS1-MS-1, PS1-MS-3, PS1-MS-5)
 • The total number of each type of atom is conserved, and thus the mass does not change. (PS1-MS-5)
 • Some chemical reactions release energy, others store energy. (PS1-MS-6)
PS3.A: Definitions of Energy
 • The term “heat” as used in everyday language refers both to thermal energy (the motion of atoms or molecules with in a substance) and the
     transfer of that thermal energy from one object to another. In science, heat is used only for this second meaning; it refers to the energy
     transferred due to the temperature difference between two objects. (PS1-MS-4)
 • The temperature of a system is proportional to the average internal kinetic energy and potential energy per atom or molecule (whichever is
     the appropriate building block for the system’s material). The details of that relationship depend on the type of atom or molecule and the
     interactions among the atoms in the material. Temperature is not a direct measure of a system’s total thermal energy. The total thermal
     energy (sometimes called total internal energy) of a system depends jointly on the temperature, the total number of atoms in the system, and
     the state of the material. (PS1-MS-6)
ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions
 • A solution needs to be tested, and then modified on the basis of the test results in order to improve it. (PS1-MS-6)
March 2018                                                                                                Science Content Standards / Academics / SDE / 35

     refinement and ultimately to an optimal solution. (PS1-MS-6)

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
PS2-MS-1.       Apply Newton’s Third Law to design a solution to a problem involving the motion of two colliding objects.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of practical problems could include the impact of collisions between two cars, between a car and stationary
     objects, and between a meteor and a space vehicle.
  • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to vertical or horizontal interactions in one dimension.
PS2-MS-2.       Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object
and the mass of the object.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on balanced (Newton’s First Law) and unbalanced forces in a system, qualitative comparisons of forces, mass
     and changes in motion (Newton’s Second Law), frame of reference, and specification of units.
  • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to forces and changes in motion in one-dimension in an inertial reference frame and to change in one
     variable at a time. Assessment does not include the use of trigonometry.
PS2-MS-3.       Ask questions about data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces.

PS2-MS-5.       Conduct an investigation and evaluate the experimental design to provide evidence that fields exist between objects exerting
forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of this phenomenon could include the interactions of magnets, electrically-charged strips of tape, and
     electrically-charged pith balls. Examples of investigations could include first-hand experiences orsimulations.
  • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to electric and magnetic fields, and limited to qualitative evidence for the existence of fields.

PS2.A: Forces and Motion
 • For any pair of interacting objects, the force exerted by the first object on the second object is equal in strength to the force that the second
     object exerts on the first, but in the opposite direction (Newton’s third law). (PS2-MS-1)
 • The motion of an object is determined by the sum of the forces acting on it; if the total force on the object is not zero, its motion will change.
     The greater the mass of the object, the greater the force needed to achieve the same change in motion. For any given object, a larger force
     causes a larger change in motion. (PS2-MS-2)
 • All positions of objects and the directions of forces and motions must be described in an arbitrarily chosen reference frame and arbitrarily
     chosen units of size. In order to share information with other people, these choices must also be shared. (PS2-MS-2)
PS2.B: Types of Interactions
 • Electric and magnetic (electromagnetic) forces can be attractive or repulsive, and their sizes depend on the magnitudes of the charges,
     currents, or magnetic strengths involved and on the distances between the interacting objects. (PS2-MS-3)
 • Gravitational forces are always attractive. There is a gravitational force between any two masses, but it is very small except when one or both
     of the objects have large mass—e.g., Earth and the sun. (PS2-MS-4)
 • Forces that act at a distance (electric, magnetic, and gravitational) can be explained by fields that extend through space and can be mapped by
     their effect on a test object (a charged object, or a ball, respectively). (PS2-MS-5)
PS3-MS Energy
                                                                  Performance Standards
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
PS3-MS-1.      Construct and interpret graphical displays of data to describe the relationships of kinetic energy to the mass of an object and to
the speed of an object.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on descriptive relationships between kinetic energy and mass separately from kinetic energy and speed.
     Examples could include riding a bicycle at different speeds, rolling different sizes of rocks downhill, and getting hit by a wiffle ball versus a
     tennis ball.
PS3-MS-2.      Develop a model to describe that when the arrangement of objects interacting at a distance changes, different amounts of
potential energy are stored in the system.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on relative amounts of potential energy, not on calculations of potential energy. Examples of objects within
     systems interacting at varying distances could include: the Earth and either a roller coaster cart at varying positions on a hill or objects at
     varying heights on shelves, changing the direction/orientation of a magnet, and a balloon with static electrical charge being brought closer to
     a classmate’s hair. Examples of models could include representations, diagrams, pictures, and written descriptions of systems.
 • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to two objects and electric, magnetic, and gravitational interactions.
PS3-MS-3.      Apply scientific principles to design, construct, and test a device that either minimizes or maximizes thermal energy transfer.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of devices could include an insulated box, a solar cooker, and a Styrofoam cup.

  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include calculating the total amount of thermal energy transferred.
PS3-MS-4.      Plan an investigation to determine the relationships among the energy transferred, the type of matter, the mass, and the change
in the average kinetic energy of the particles as measured by the temperature of the sample.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of experiments could include comparing final water temperatures after different masses of ice melted in the
     same volume of water with the same initial temperature, the temperature change of samples of different materials with the same mass as
     they cool or heat in the environment, or the same material with different masses when a specific amount of energy is added.
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include calculating the total amount of thermal energy transferred.
PS3-MS-5.      Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, energy is
transferred to or from the object.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of empirical evidence used in arguments could include an inventory or other representation of the energy
     before and after the transfer in the form of temperature changes or motion of object.
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include calculations of energy.
                                                                 Supporting Content
PS3.A: Definitions of Energy
  • Motion energy is properly called kinetic energy; it is proportional to the mass of the moving object and grows with the square of its speed.
     (PS3-MS-1)
  • A system of objects may also contain stored (potential) energy, depending on their relative positions. (PS3-MS-2)
  • Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles of matter. The relationship between the temperature and the total energy
     of a system depends on the types, states, and amounts of matter present. (PS3-MS-3, PS3-MS-4)
PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer
  • When the motion energy of an object changes, there is inevitably some other change in energy at the same time. (PS3-MS-5)
  • The amount of energy transfer needed to change the temperature of a matter sample by a given amount depends on the nature of the
     matter, the size of the sample, and the environment. (PS3-MS-4)
  • Energy is spontaneously transferred out of hotter regions or objects and into colder ones. (PS3-MS-3)
PS3.C: Relationship Between Energy and Forces
  • When two objects interact, each one exerts a force on the other that can cause energy to be transferred to or from the object. (PS3-MS-2)
ETS1.A: Defining and Delimiting an Engineering Problem
  • The more precisely a design task’s criteria and constraints can be defined, the more likely it is that the designed solution will be successful.
     Specification of constraints includes consideration of scientific principles and other relevant knowledge that is likely to limit possible solutions.
     (PS3-MS-3)
ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions
  • A solution needs to be tested, and then modified on the basis of the test results in order to improve it. There are systematic processes for
     evaluating solutions with respect to how well they meet criteria and constraints of a problem. (PS3-MS-3)

     fiber optic cable to transmit light pulses, radio wave pulses in WIFI devices, and conversion of stored binary patterns to make sound or text on
     a computer screen.

PS4.A: Wave Properties
 • A simple wave has a repeating pattern with a specific wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. (PS4-MS-1)
 • A sound wave needs a medium through which it is transmitted. (PS4-MS-2)
PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation
 • When light shines on an object, it is reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through the object, depending on the object’s material and the
     frequency (color) of the light. (PS4- MS-2)
 • The path that light travels can be traced as straight lines, except at surfaces between different transparent materials (e.g., air and water, air
     and glass) where the light path bends. (PS4-MS-2)
 • A wave model of light is useful for explaining brightness, color, and the frequency-dependent bending of light at a surface between media.
     (PS4-MS-2)
 • However, because light can travel through space, it cannot be a matter wave, like sound or water waves. (PS4-MS-2)

LS1.A: Structure and Function
  • All living things are made up of cells, which is the smallest unit that can be said to be alive. An organism may consist of one single cell
     (unicellular) or many different numbers and types of cells (multicellular). (LS1-MS-1)
  • Within cells, special structures are responsible for particular functions, and the cell membrane forms the boundary that controls what enters
     and leaves the cell. (LS1-MS-2)

     cycles, made of cells, etc.) (LS1-MS-4)
LS1.C: Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms
  • Plants, algae (including phytoplankton), and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from
     the atmosphere and water through the process of photosynthesis, which also releases oxygen. These sugars can be used immediately or
     stored for growth or later use. (LS1-MS-5)
  • Within individual organisms, food moves through a series of chemical reactions (cellular respiration) in which it is broken down and
     rearranged to form new molecules, to support growth, or to release energy. (LS1-MS-6)

LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems
 • Organisms, and populations of organisms, are dependent on their environmental interactions both with other living things and with nonliving
     factors. (LS2-MS-1)
 • In any ecosystem, organisms and populations with similar requirements for food, water, oxygen, or other resources may compete with each
     other for limited resources, access to which consequently constrains their growth and reproduction. (LS2-MS-1)
 • Growth of organisms and population increases are limited by access to resources. (LS2-MS-1)
 • Similarly, predatory interactions may reduce the number of organisms or eliminate whole populations of organisms. Mutually beneficial
     interactions, in contrast, may become so interdependent that each organism requires the other for survival. Although the species involved in
     these competitive, predatory, and mutually beneficial interactions vary across ecosystems, the patterns of interactions of organisms with their
     environments, both living and nonliving, are shared. (LS2-MS-2)
LS2.B: Cycle of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems
 • Food webs are models that demonstrate how matter and energy is transferred between producers, consumers, and decomposers as the three
     groups interact within an ecosystem. Transfers of matter into and out of the physical environment occur at every level. Decomposers recycle
     nutrients from dead plant or animal matter back to the soil in terrestrial environments or to the water in aquatic environments. The atoms
     that make up the organisms in an ecosystem are cycled repeatedly between the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. (LS2-MS-3)
 • Food webs can be broken down into multiple energy pyramids. Concepts should include the 10% rule of energy and biomass transfer between
     trophic levels and the environment. (LS2-MS-4)
LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience
 • Ecosystems are dynamic in nature; their characteristics can vary over time. Disruptions to any physical or biological component of an
     ecosystem can lead to shifts in all its populations. (LS2-MS-5)
 • Biodiversity describes the variety of species found in Earth’s terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. The completeness or integrity of an
     ecosystem’s biodiversity is often used as a measure of its health. (LS2-MS-6)

function of the organism.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on conceptual understanding that changes in genetic material may result in making different proteins.
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include specific changes at the molecular level, mechanisms for protein synthesis, or specific types of
     mutations.
LS3-MS-2.      Develop and use a model to describe why asexual reproduction results in offspring with identical genetic information and sexual
reproduction results in offspring with genetic variation.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using models such as Punnett squares, diagrams, and simulations to describe the cause and effect
     relationship of gene transmission from parent(s) to offspring and resulting genetic variation.
                                                                  Supporting Content
LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms
  • Organisms reproduce, either sexually or asexually, and transfer their genetic information to their offspring. (LS3-MS-2)
LS3.A: Inheritance of Traits
  • Genes are located in the chromosomes of cells, with each chromosome pair containing two variants of each of many distinct genes. Each
     distinct gene chiefly controls the production of specific proteins, which in turn affects the traits of the individual. Changes (mutations) to
     genes can result in changes to proteins, which can affect the structures and functions of the organism and thereby change traits. (LS3-MS-1)
  • Variations of inherited traits between parent and offspring arise from genetic differences that result from the subset of chromosomes (and
     therefore genes) inherited. (LS3-MS-2)
LS3.B: Variation of Traits
  • In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes half of the genes acquired (at random) by the offspring. Individuals have two of
     each chromosome and hence two alleles of each gene, one acquired from each parent. These versions may be identical or may differ from
     each other. (LS3-MS-2)
March 2018                                                                                                   Science Content Standards / Academics / SDE / 43


  •   In addition to variations that arise from sexual reproduction, genetic information can be altered because of mutations. Though rare,
      mutations may result in changes to the structure and function of proteins. Some changes are beneficial, others harmful, and some neutral to
      the organism. (LS3-MS-1)

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
LS4-MS-1.         Analyze and interpret data for patterns in the fossil record that document the existence, diversity, extinction, and change of life
forms throughout the history of life on Earth under the assumption that natural laws operate today as in the past.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on finding patterns of changes in the level of complexity of anatomical structures in organisms and the
      chronological order of fossil appearance in the rock layers.
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include the names of individual species or geological eras in the fossil record.
LS4-MS-2.         Apply scientific ideas to construct an explanation for the anatomical similarities and differences among modern organisms and
between modern and fossil organisms to infer relationships.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on explanations of the relationships among organisms in terms of similarity or differences of the gross
      appearance of anatomical structures.
LS4-MS-3.         Analyze displays of pictorial data to compare patterns of similarities in the anatomical structures across multiple species of similar
classification levels to identify relationships.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on inferring general patterns of relatedness among structures of different organisms by comparing the
      appearance of diagrams or pictures.
  • Content Limit: Assessment of comparisons is limited to gross appearance of anatomical structures within genus and species levels. No
      memorization of classification levels is required.
LS4-MS-4.         Construct an explanation based on evidence that describes how genetic variations of traits in a population increase some
individuals’ probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific environment.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using concepts of natural selection like overproduction of offspring, passage of time, variation in a
      population, selection of favorable traits, and heritability of traits.
LS4-MS-5.         Gather and synthesize information about the technologies that have changed the way humans influence the inheritance of
desired traits in organisms.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on synthesizing information from reliable sources about the influence of humans on genetic outcomes in
      artificial selection (such as genetic modification, animal husbandry, gene therapy); and, on the impacts these technologies have on society as
      well as the technologies leading to these scientific discoveries.

LS4-MS-6.        Use mathematical representations to support explanations of how natural selection may lead to increases and decreases of
specific traits in populations over time.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using mathematical models, probability statements, and proportional reasoning to support explanations
     of trends in changes to populations over time. Examples could include Peppered moth population changes before and after the industrial
     revolution.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include Hardy Weinberg calculations.

LS4.A: Classification of Organisms
 • The collection of fossils and their placement in chronological order is known as the fossil record and documents the change of many life forms
     throughout the history of the Earth. Anatomical similarities and differences between various organisms living today and between them and
     organisms in the fossil record enable the classification of living things. (LS4-MS-1, LS4-MS-2)
 • Scientific genus and species level names indicate a degree of relationship. (LS4-MS-3)
LS4.B: Natural Selection
 • Natural selection leads to the predominance of certain traits in a population, and the suppression of others. (LS4-MS-4)
 • In artificial selection, humans have the capacity to influence certain characteristics of organisms by selective breeding. One can choose
     desired parental traits determined by genes, which are then passed on to offspring. (LS4-MS-5)
LS4.C: Adaptation
 • Adaptation by natural selection acting over generations is one important process by which species change over time in response to changes in
     environmental conditions. Traits that support successful survival and reproduction in the new environment become more common; those that
     do not become less common. Thus, the distribution of traits in a population changes. (LS4-MS-6)

moon, and seasons.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of models can be physical, graphical, or conceptual.
ESS1-MS-2. Develop and use a model to describe the role of gravity in the motions within galaxies and the solar system.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis for the model is on gravity as the force that holds together the solar system and Milky Way galaxy and controls
     orbital motions within them. Examples of models can be physical (such as the analogy of distance along a football field or computer
     visualizations of elliptical orbits) or conceptual (such as mathematical proportions relative to the size of familiar objects such as students’
     school or state).
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include Kepler’s Laws of orbital motion or the apparent retrograde motion of the planets as viewed from
     Earth.
ESS1-MS-3. Analyze and interpret data to determine scale properties of objects in the solar system.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the analysis of data from Earth-based instruments, space-based telescopes, and spacecraft to determine
     similarities and differences among solar system objects. Examples of scale properties include the sizes of an object’s layers (such as crust and
     atmosphere), surface features (such as volcanoes), and orbital radius. Examples of data include statistical information, drawings and
     photographs, and models.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include recalling facts about properties of the planets and other solar system bodies.
ESS1-MS-4. Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence from rock strata for how the geologic time scale is used to organize Earth’s
history.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how analyses of rock formations and the fossils they contain are used to establish relative ages of major
     events in Earth’s history. Examples of Earth’s major events could range from being very recent (such as the last Ice Age or the earliest fossils of
     homo sapiens) to very old (such as the formation of Earth or the earliest evidence of life). Examples can include the formation of mountain
     chains and ocean basins, the evolution or extinction of particular living organisms, or large volcanic eruptions.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include recalling the names of specific periods or epochs and events within them.

ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System
 • The solar system consists of the sun and a collection of objects, including planets, their moons, and asteroids that are held in orbit around the
     sun by its gravitational pull on them. (ESS1-MS-2, ESS1-MS-3)
 • This model of the solar system can explain eclipses of the sun and the moon. Earth’s spin axis is fixed in direction over the short-term but
     tilted relative to its orbit around the sun. The seasons are a result of that tilt and are caused by the differential intensity of sunlight on
     different areas of Earth across the year. (ESS1-MS-1)
 • The solar system appears to have formed from a disk of dust and gas, drawn together by gravity. (ESS1-MS-2)
ESS1.C: The History of Planet Earth
 • The geologic time scale interpreted from rock strata provides a way to organize Earth’s history. Analyses of rock strata and the fossil record
     provide only relative dates, not an absolute scale. (ESS1-MS-4)

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
ESS2-MS-1. Develop a model to describe the cycling of Earth’s materials and the flow of energy that drives this process.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the processes of melting, crystallization, weathering, deformation, and sedimentation, which act together
     to form minerals and rocks through the cycling of Earth’s materials.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include the identification and naming of minerals.
ESS2-MS-2. Construct an explanation based on evidence for how geoscience processes have changed Earth’s surface at varying time and
spatial scales.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how processes change Earth’s surface at time and spatial scales that can be large (such as slow plate
     motions or the uplift of large mountain ranges) or small (such as rapid landslides or microscopic geochemical reactions), and how many
     geoscience processes (such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and meteor impacts) usually behave gradually but are punctuated by catastrophic
     events. Examples of geoscience processes include surface weathering and deposition by the movements of water, ice, and wind. Emphasis is
     on geoscience processes that shape local geographic features, where appropriate.
ESS2-MS-3. Analyze and interpret data on the distribution of fossils and rocks, continental shapes, and seafloor structures to provide
evidence of the past plate motions.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of data include similarities of rock and fossil types on different continents, the shapes of the continents
     (including continental shelves), and the locations of ocean structures (such as ridges, fracture zones, and trenches).
 • Content Limit: Paleomagnetic anomalies in oceanic and continental crust are not assessed.
ESS2-MS-4. Develop a model to describe the cycling of water through Earth’s systems driven by energy from the sun and the force of gravity.

ESS2-MS-5. Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses results in changes in weather
conditions.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure, causing weather (defined by
     temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind) at a fixed location to change over time, and how sudden changes in weather can
     result when different air masses collide. Emphasis is on how weather can be predicted within probabilistic ranges. Examples of data can be
     provided to students (such as weather maps, diagrams, and visualizations) or obtained through laboratory experiments (such as with
     condensation).
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include recalling the names of cloud types or weather symbols used on weather maps or the reported
     diagrams from weather stations.
ESS2-MS-6. Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of the Earth cause patterns of atmospheric and oceanic
circulation that determine regional climates.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how patterns vary by latitude, altitude, and geographic land distribution. Emphasis of atmospheric
     circulation is on the sunlight- driven latitudinal banding, the Coriolis effect, and resulting prevailing winds; emphasis of ocean circulation is on
     the transfer of heat by the global ocean convection cycle, which is constrained by the Coriolis effect and the outlines of continents. Examples
     of models can be diagrams, maps and globes, or digital representations.
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include the dynamics of the Coriolis effect.

ESS1.C: The History of Planet Earth
  • Tectonic processes continually generate new ocean sea floor at ridges and destroy old sea floor at trenches. (ESS2-MS-3)
ESS2.A: Earth’s Materials and Systems
  • All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among the planet’s systems. This energy is derived from the
     sun and Earth’s hot interior. The energy that flows and matter that cycles produce chemical and physical changes in Earth’s materials and
     living organisms. (ESS2-MS-1)
  • The planet’s systems interact over scales that range from microscopic to global in size, and they operate over fractions of a second to billions
     of years. These interactions have shaped Earth’s history and will determine its future. (ESS2-MS-2)
ESS2.B: Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions
  • Maps of ancient land and water patterns, based on investigations of rocks and fossils, make clear how Earth’s plates have moved great

ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth’s Surface Processes
  • Water continually cycles among land, ocean, and atmosphere via transpiration, evaporation, condensation and crystallization, and
     precipitation, as well as downhill flows on land. (ESS2-MS-4)
  • The complex patterns of the changes and the movement of water in the atmosphere, determined by winds, landforms, and ocean
     temperatures and currents, are major determinants of local weather patterns. (ESS2-MS-5)

 •   Variations in density due to variations in temperature and salinity drive a global pattern of interconnected ocean currents. (ESS2-MS-6)
 •   Water’s movements—both on the land and underground—cause weathering and erosion, which change the land’s surface features and
     create underground formations. (ESS2-MS-2)
ESS2.D: Weather and Climate
 • Weather and climate are influenced by interactions involving sunlight, the ocean, the atmosphere, ice, landforms, and living things. These
     interactions vary with latitude, altitude, and local and regional geography, all of which can affect oceanic and atmospheric flow patterns.
     (ESS2-MS-6)
 • Because these patterns are so complex, weather can only be predicted using probability. (ESS2-MS-5)
 • The ocean exerts a major influence on weather and climate by absorbing energy from the sun, releasing it over time, and globally
     redistributing it through ocean currents. (ESS2-MS-6)
ESS3-MS Earth and Human Activity

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
ESS3-MS-1. Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for how the uneven distributions of Earth’s mineral, energy, and
groundwater resources are the result of past and current geoscience processes.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how these resources are limited and typically non-renewable, and how their distributions are changing as
     a result of removal by humans. Examples of uneven distributions of resources as a result of past processes include but are not limited to
     petroleum (locations of the burial of organic marine sediments and subsequent geologic traps), metal ores (locations of past volcanic and
     hydrothermal activity associated with subduction zones), and soil (locations of active weathering and/or deposition of rock).
ESS3-MS-2. Analyze and interpret data on natural hazards to forecast future catastrophic events and inform the development of technologies
to mitigate their effects.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and severe weather, are preceded by phenomena
     that allow for reliable predictions, but others, such as earthquakes, occur suddenly and with no notice, and thus are not yet predictable.
     Examples of natural hazards can be taken from interior processes (such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions), surface processes (such as
     mass wasting and tsunamis), or severe weather events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). Examples of data can include the locations,
     magnitudes, and frequencies of the natural hazards. Examples of technologies can be global (such as satellite systems to monitor hurricanes
     or forest fires) or local (such as building basements in tornado-prone regions or reservoirs to mitigate droughts).
ESS3-MS-3. Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of the design process include examining human environmental impacts, assessing the kinds of solutions that
     are feasible, and designing and evaluating solutions that could reduce that impact. Examples of human impacts can include water usage (such
     as the withdrawal of water from streams and aquifers or the construction of dams and levees), land usage (such as urban development,
     agriculture, or the removal of wetlands), and pollution (such as of the air, water, or land).

ESS3-MS-4. Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and per-capita consumption of natural
resources impact Earth’s systems.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of evidence include grade-appropriate databases on human populations and the rates of consumption of food
     and natural resources (such as freshwater, mineral, and energy). Examples of impacts can include changes to the appearance, composition,
     and structure of Earth’s systems as well as the rates at which they change. The consequences of increases in human populations and
     consumption of natural resources are described by science, but science does not make the decisions for the actions society takes.
ESS3-MS-5. Ask questions to interpret evidence of the factors that cause climate variability over time.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of factors include human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion and changes in land use) and natural
     processes (such as changes in incoming solar radiation and volcanic activity). Examples of evidence can include tables, graphs, and maps of
     global and regional temperatures, atmospheric levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and natural resource use.
                                                                 Supporting Content
ESS3.A: Natural Resources
 • Humans depend on Earth’s land, ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere for many different resources. Minerals, fresh water, and biosphere
     resources are limited, and many are not renewable or replaceable over human lifetimes. These resources are distributed unevenly around the
     planet as a result of past geologic processes. (ESS3-MS-1)
ESS3.B: Natural Hazards
 • Mapping the history of natural hazards in a region, combined with an understanding of related geologic forces can help forecast the locations
     and likelihoods of future events. (ESS3-MS-2)
ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems
 • Human activities can have consequences (positive and negative) on the biosphere, sometimes altering natural habitats and causing the
     extinction of other species. (ESS3-MS-3)
 • Technology and engineering can potentially mitigate impacts on Earth’s systems as both human populations and per-capita consumption of
     natural resources increase. (ESS3-MS-3, ESS3-MS-4)
 • Mitigating current changes in climate depends on understanding climate science. Current scientific models indicate that human activities,
     such as the release of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion, are the primary factors in the present-day measured rise in Earth’s mean
     surface temperature. Natural activities, such as changes in incoming solar radiation, also contribute to changing global temperatures. (ESS3-

 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the conceptual understanding of the inputs and outputs of the process of cellular respiration.
 • Content Limit: Assessment should not include identification of the steps or specific processes involved in cellular respiration.
                                                                    Supporting Content
LS1.A: Structure and Function
 • Systems of specialized cells within organisms help them perform the essential functions of life. (LS1-HS-1)
 • All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the instructions that code for
     the formation of proteins, which carry out most of the work of cells. (LS1-HS-1)
 • Multicellular organisms have a hierarchical structural organization, in which any one system is made up of numerous parts and is itself a
     component of the next level. (LS1- HS-2)
 • Feedback mechanisms maintain a living system’s internal conditions within certain limits and mediate behaviors, allowing it to remain alive
     and functional even as external conditions change within some range. Feedback mechanisms can encourage (through positive feedback) or
     discourage (negative feedback) what is going on inside the living system. (LS1-HS-3)
LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms
 • In multicellular organisms individual cells grow and then divide via a process called mitosis, thereby allowing the organism to grow. The
     organism begins as a single cell (fertilized egg) that divides successively to produce many cells, with each parent cell passing identical genetic
     material (two variants of each chromosome pair) to both daughter cells. Cellular division and differentiation produce and maintain a complex
     organism, composed of systems of tissues and organs that work together to meet the needs of the whole organism. (LS1-HS-4)
LS1.C: Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms
 • The process of photosynthesis converts light energy to stored chemical energy by converting carbon dioxide plus water into sugars plus
     released oxygen. (LS1-HS-5)
 • The sugar molecules thus formed contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen: their hydrocarbon backbones are used to make amino acids and
     other carbon-based molecules that can be assembled into larger molecules (such as proteins or DNA), used for example to form new cells.
     (LS1-HS-6)
 • As matter and energy flow through different organizational levels of living systems, chemical elements are recombined in different ways to
     form different products. (LS1- HS-6, LS1-HS-7)
 • As a result of these chemical reactions, energy is transferred from one system of interacting molecules to another. Cellular respiration is a
     chemical process in which the bonds of food molecules and oxygen molecules are broken and new compounds are formed that can transport
     energy to cells. Cellular respiration also releases the energy needed to maintain body temperature despite ongoing energy transfer to the
     surrounding environment. (LS1-HS-7)

LS2-HS-1.      Use mathematical and/or computational representations to support explanations of factors that affect carrying capacity of
ecosystems at different scales.

LS2-HS-2.      Use mathematical representations to support and revise explanations based on evidence about factors affecting biodiversity and
populations in ecosystems of different scales.

LS2-HS-4.      Use mathematical representations to support claims for the cycling of matter and flow of energy among organisms in an
ecosystem.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using a mathematical model of stored energy in biomass to describe the transfer of energy from one
     trophic level to another and that matter and energy are conserved as matter cycles and energy flows through ecosystems. Emphasis is on
     atoms and molecules such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen being conserved as they move through an ecosystem.
 • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to proportional reasoning to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy.

LS2-HS-6.      Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers
and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new ecosystem.

     flood; and extreme changes, such as volcanic eruption or sea level rise.

LS2-HS-7.        Design, evaluate, and refine a solution for reducing the impacts of human activities on the environment and biodiversity.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of human activities can include urbanization, building dams, and dissemination of invasive species, utilization of
     non-renewable resources as opposed to renewable resource.
LS2-HS-8.        Evaluate the evidence for the role of group behavior on individual and species’ chances to survive and reproduce.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on: (1) distinguishing between group and individual behavior, (2) identifying evidence supporting the
     outcomes of group behavior, and (3) developing logical and reasonable arguments based on evidence. Examples of group behaviors could
     include flocking, schooling, herding, and cooperative behaviors such as hunting, migrating, and swarming.
                                                                   Supporting Content
LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems
 • Ecosystems have carrying capacities, which are limits to the numbers of organisms and populations they can support. These limits result from
     such factors as the availability of living and nonliving resources and from such challenges such as predation, competition, and disease.
     Organisms would have the capacity to produce populations of great size were it not for the fact that environments and resources are finite.
     This fundamental tension affects the abundance (number of individuals) of species in any given ecosystem. (LS2-HS-1, LS2-HS-2)
LS2.B: Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems
 • Photosynthesis and cellular respiration (including anaerobic processes) provide most of the energy for life processes. (LS2-HS-3)
 • Plants or algae form the lowest level of the food web. At each link upward in a food web, only a small fraction of the matter consumed at the
     lower level is transferred upward, to produce growth and release energy in cellular respiration at the higher level. Given this inefficiency,
     there are generally fewer organisms at higher levels of a food web. Some matter reacts to release energy for life functions, some matter is
     stored in newly made structures, and much is discarded. The chemical elements that make up the molecules of organisms pass through food
     webs and into and out of the atmosphere and soil, and they are combined and recombined in different ways. At each link in an ecosystem,
     matter and energy are conserved. (LS2-HS-4)
 • Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are important components of the carbon cycle, in which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere,
     atmosphere, oceans, and geosphere through chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. (LS2-HS-5)
LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience
 • A complex set of interactions within an ecosystem can keep its numbers and types of organisms relatively constant over long periods of time
     under stable conditions. If a modest biological or physical disturbance to an ecosystem occurs, it may return to its more or less original status
     (i.e., the ecosystem is resilient), as opposed to becoming a very different ecosystem. Extreme fluctuations in conditions or the size of any
     population, however, can challenge the functioning of ecosystems in terms of resources and habitat availability. (LS2-HS-2, LS2-HS-6)
 • Moreover, anthropogenic changes (induced by human activity) in the environment—including habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of
     invasive species, overexploitation, and climate change—can disrupt an ecosystem and threaten the survival of some species. (LS2-HS-7)
LS2.D: Social Interactions and Group Behavior
 • Group behavior has evolved because membership can increase the chances of survival for individuals and their genetic relatives, gene pool.

LS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans
 • Biodiversity is increased by the formation of new species (speciation) and decreased by the loss of species (extinction). (LS2-HS-7)
 • Sustaining ecosystem health and biodiversity is essential to support and enhance life on Earth. Sustaining biodiversity also aids humanity by
     preserving landscapes of recreational, cultural, or inspirational value. Humans depend on the living world for the resources and other benefits
     provided by biodiversity. Impacts on biodiversity can be mitigated through actions such as habitat conservation, reclamation practices, wildlife
     management, and invasive species control. Understanding the effects of population growth, wildfire, pollution, and climate variability on
     changes in biodiversity could help maintain the integrity of biological systems. (LS2-HS-7, LS4-HS-6.)
LS3-HS Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits
                                                                 Performance Standards
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
LS3-HS- 1.     Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits
passed from parents to offspring.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include the phases of meiosis or the biochemical mechanism of specific steps in the process.
LS3-HS-2.      Make and defend a claim based on evidence that inheritable genetic variations may result from: (1) new genetic combinations
through meiosis, (2) viable errors occurring during replication, and/or (3) mutations caused by environmental factors.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using data to support arguments for the way variation occurs.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include the phases of meiosis or the biochemical mechanism of specific steps in the process.
LS3-HS-3.      Apply concepts of statistics and probability to explain the variation and distribution of expressed traits in a population.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the use of mathematics to describe the probability of traits (alleles) as it relates to genetic and
     environmental factors in the expression of traits.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include Hardy-Weinberg calculations.
                                                                   Supporting Content
LS1.A: Structure and Function
 • All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the instructions that code for
     the formation of proteins. (LS3- HS-1, LS1-HS-1.)
LS3.A: Inheritance of Traits
 • Each chromosome consists of a single very long DNA molecule, and each gene on the chromosome is a particular segment of that DNA. The
     instructions for forming species’ characteristics are carried in DNA. All cells in an organism have the same genetic content, but the genes used
     (expressed) by the cell may be regulated in different ways. Not all DNA codes for a protein; some segments of DNA are involved in regulatory
     or structural functions, and some have no as-yet known function. (LS3-HS-1)
LS3.B: Variation of Traits
 • In sexual reproduction, chromosomes can sometimes swap sections during the process of meiosis (cell division), thereby creating new genetic
     combinations and thus more genetic variation. Although DNA replication is tightly regulated and remarkably accurate, errors do occur and
March 2018                                                                                                 Science Content Standards / Academics / SDE / 55


     result in mutations, which are also a source of genetic variation. Environmental factors can also cause mutations in genes, and viable
     mutations are inherited. (LS3-HS-2)
  •  Environmental factors also affect expression of traits, and hence affect the probability of occurrences of traits in a population. Thus the
     variation and distribution of traits observed depends on both genetic and environmental factors. (LS3-HS-2, LS3-HS-3)
LS4-HS Biological Adaptation: Unity and Diversity

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
LS4-HS- 1.     Communicate scientific information that common ancestry and biological evolution are supported by multiple lines of empirical
evidence.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on a conceptual understanding of the role each line of evidence has relating to common ancestry and
     biological evolution. Examples of evidence could include similarities in DNA sequences, anatomical structures, and order of appearance of
     structures in embryological development.
LS4-HS-2.      Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors: (1) the potential for
a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3)
competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using evidence to explain the influence each of the four factors has on number of organisms, behaviors,
     morphology, or physiology in terms of ability to compete for limited resources and subsequent survival of individuals and adaptation of
     species. Examples of evidence could include mathematical models such as simple distribution graphs and proportional reasoning.
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include other mechanisms of evolution, such as genetic drift, gene flow through migration, and co-
     evolution.
LS4-HS-3.      Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous heritable trait tend to
increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on analyzing shifts in numerical distribution of traits and using these shifts as evidence to support
     explanations.
  • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to basic statistical and graphical analysis. Assessment does not include allele frequency calculations.
LS4-HS-4.      Construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural selection leads to adaptation of populations.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using data to provide evidence for how specific biotic and abiotic differences in ecosystems (such as
     ranges of seasonal temperature, long-term climate change, acidity, light, geographic barriers, or evolution of other organisms) contribute to a
     change in gene frequency over time, leading to adaptation of populations.
March 2018                                                                                               Science Content Standards / Academics / SDE / 56


LS4-HS-5.       Evaluate the evidence supporting claims that changes in environmental conditions may result in: (1) increases in the number of
individuals of some species, (2) the emergence of new species over time, and (3) the extinction of other species.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on determining cause and effect relationships for how changes to the environment such as deforestation,
     over fishing, application of fertilizers and pesticides, drought, flood, and the rate of change of the environment affect distribution or
     disappearance of traits in species.
LS4-HS-6.       Create or revise a simulation to test a solution to mitigate adverse impacts of human activity on biodiversity.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on designing solutions for a proposed problem related to threatened or endangered species, or to genetic
     variation of organisms for multiple species.
                                                                    Supporting Content
LS4.A: Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity
  • Genetic information, like the fossil record, provides evidence of evolution. DNA sequences vary among species, but there are many overlaps;
     in fact, the ongoing branching that produces multiple lines of descent can be inferred by comparing the DNA sequences of different
     organisms. Such information is also derivable from the similarities and differences in amino acid sequences and from anatomical and
     embryological evidence. (LS4-HS-1)
LS4.B: Natural Selection
  • Natural selection occurs only if there is both (1) variation in the genetic information between organisms in a population and (2) variation in
     the expression of that genetic information—that is, trait variation—that leads to differences in performance among individuals. (LS4-HS-2,
     LS4-HS-3)
  • The traits that positively affect survival are more likely to be reproduced, and thus are more common in the population. (LS4-HS-3)
LS4.C: Adaptation
  • Evolution is a consequence of the interaction of four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the genetic variation of
     individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for an environment’s limited supply of the resources that
     individuals need in order to survive and reproduce, and (4) the ensuing proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and
     reproduce in that environment. (LS4-HS-2)
  • Natural selection leads to adaptation, that is, to a population dominated by organisms that are anatomically, behaviorally, and physiologically
     well suited to survive and reproduce in a specific environment. That is, the differential survival and reproduction of organisms in a population
     that have an advantageous heritable trait leads to an increase in the proportion of individuals in future generations that have the trait and to
     a decrease in the proportion of individuals that do not. (LS4-HS-3, LS4-HS-4)
  • Adaptation also means that the distribution of traits in a population can change when conditions change. (LS4-HS-3)
  • Changes in the physical environment, whether naturally occurring or human induced, have thus contributed to the expansion of some species,
     the emergence of new distinct species as populations diverge under different conditions, and the decline–and sometimes the extinction–of
     some species. (LS4-HS-5, LS4-HS-6)
  • Species become extinct because they can no longer survive and reproduce in their altered environment. If members cannot adjust to change
     that is too fast or drastic, the opportunity for the species’ evolution is lost. (LS4-HS-5)

 • When evaluating solutions, it is important to take into account a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, and to
     consider social, cultural, and environmental impacts. (LS4-HS-6)
 • Both physical models and computers can be used in various ways to aid in the engineering design process. Computers are useful for a variety
     of purposes, such as running simulations to test different ways of solving a problem or to see which one is most efficient or economical; and in
     making a persuasive presentation to a client about how a given design will meet his or her needs. (LS4-HS-6)

 •   Energy is a quantitative property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within that system. That
     there is a single quantity called energy is due to the fact that a system’s total energy is conserved, even as, within the system, energy is
     continually transferred from one object to another and between its various possible forms. (PSC3-HS-2, PSC3-HS-3)
 • At the macroscopic scale, energy manifests itself in multiple ways, such as in motion, sound, light, and thermal energy. (PSC3-HS-3, PSC3-HS-4)
 • These relationships are better understood at the microscopic scale, at which all of the different manifestations of energy can be modeled as a
     combination of energy associated with the motion of particles and energy associated with the configuration (relative position of the particles).
     In some cases the relative position energy can be thought of as stored in fields (which mediate interactions between particles). This last
     concept includes radiation, a phenomenon in which energy stored in fields moves across space. (PSC3-HS-3)
PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer
 • Conservation of energy means that the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total energy transferred into or out of the

     PSC3-HS-5)
 • Mathematical expressions, which quantify how the stored energy in a system depends on its configuration (e.g. relative positions of charged
     particles, compression of a spring) and how kinetic energy depends on mass and speed, allow the concept of conservation of energy to be
     used to predict and describe system behavior. (PSC3-HS-2)
 • The availability of energy limits what can occur in any system. (PSC3-HS-2)
 • Uncontrolled systems always evolve toward more stable states—that is, toward more uniform energy distribution (e.g., water flows downhill,
     objects hotter than their surrounding environment cool down). (PSC3-HS-5)

Students who demonstrate understanding can:
ESS1-HS-1.     Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the life span of the sun and the role of nuclear fusion in the sun’s core to release
energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of radiation.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the energy transfer mechanisms that allow energy from nuclear fusion in the sun’s core to reach Earth.
     Examples of evidence for the model include observations of the masses and lifetimes of other stars, as well as the ways that the sun’s
     radiation varies due to sudden solar flares (“space weather”), the 11-year sunspot cycle, and non-cyclic variations over centuries.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include details of the atomic and sub-atomic processes involved with the sun’s nuclear fusion.
ESS1-HS-2.     Construct an explanation of the current model of the origin of the universe based on astronomical evidence of light spectra,
motion of distant galaxies, and composition of matter in the universe.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the astronomical evidence of the redshift of light from galaxies as an indication that the universe is
     currently expanding, the cosmic microwave background as the remnant radiation from the event, and the observed composition of ordinary
     matter of the universe, primarily found in stars and interstellar gases (from the spectra of electromagnetic radiation from stars), which
     matches that predicted by the scientific model (3/4 hydrogen and 1/4 helium).
ESS1-HS-3.     Communicate scientific ideas about the way stars, over their life cycle, produce elements.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the way nucleosynthesis, and therefore the different elements created, varies as a function of the mass of
     a star and the stage of its lifetime.
 • Content Limit: Details of the many different nucleosynthesis pathways for stars of differing masses are not assessed.
ESS1-HS-4.     Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar system.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on Newtonian gravitational law s governing orbital motions, which apply to human-made satellites as well as
     planets and moons.
 • Content Limit: Mathematical representations for the gravitational attraction of bodies and Kepler’s Laws of orbital motions should not deal
     with more than two bodies, nor involve calculus.
ESS1-HS-5.     Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of continental and oceanic crust and the theory of plate tectonics to
explain the ages of crustal rocks.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the ability of plate tectonics to explain the ages of crustal rocks. Examples include evidence of the ages
     oceanic crust increasing with distance from mid-ocean ridges (a result of plate spreading) and the ages of North American continental crust
     increasing with distance away from a central ancient core (a result of past plate interactions).
March 2018                                                                                                Science Content Standards / Academics / SDE / 71


ESS1-HS-6.     Apply scientific reasoning and evidence from ancient Earth materials, meteorites, and other planetary surfaces to construct an
account of Earth’s formation and early history.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using available evidence within the solar system to reconstruct the early history of Earth, which formed
     along with the rest of the solar system. Examples of evidence include the absolute ages of ancient materials (obtained by radiometric dating
     of meteorites, moon rocks, and Earth’s oldest minerals), the sizes and compositions of solar system objects, and the impact cratering record of
     planetary surfaces.
                                                                   Supporting Content
ESS1.A: The Universe and Its Stars
 • The star called the sun is changing and will burn out over a lifespan of approximately 10 billion years. (ESS1-HS-1)
 • The study of stars’ light spectra and brightness is used to identify compositional elements of stars, their movements, and their distances from
     Earth. (ESS1-HS-2, ESS1-HS- 3)
 • The Big Bang theory is a current scientific model of the origin of the universe that is supported by evidence such as observations of distant
     galaxies receding from our own, of the measured composition of stars and non-stellar gases, and of the maps of spectra of the primordial
     radiation (cosmic microwave background) that still fills the universe. Other than the hydrogen and helium formed at the time of the event,
     nuclear fusion within stars produces all atomic nuclei lighter than and including iron, and the process releases electromagnetic energy.
     Heavier elements are produced when certain massive stars achieve a supernova stage and explode. (ESS1-HS-2, ESS1-HS-3)
ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System
 • Kepler’s laws describe common features of the motions of orbiting objects, including their elliptical paths around the sun. Orbits may change
     due to the gravitational effects from, or collisions with, other objects in the solar system. (ESS1-HS-4)
ESS1.C: The History of Planet Earth
 • Continental rocks are generally much older than the rocks of the ocean floor. (ESS1-HS-5)
 • Although active geologic processes, such as plate tectonics and erosion, have destroyed or altered most of the very early rock record on Earth,
     other objects in the solar system, such as lunar rocks, asteroids, and meteorites, have changed little over billions of years. Studying these
     objects can provide information about Earth’s formation and early history. (ESS1-HS-6)
ESS2.B: Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions
 • Plate tectonics is the unifying theory that explains the past and current movements of the rocks at Earth’s surface and provides a framework
     for understanding its geologic history. (ESS1-HS-5)
PS1.C: Nuclear Processes
 • Spontaneous radioactive decay follows a characteristic exponential decay law. Nuclear lifetimes allow radiometric dating to be used to
     determine the ages of rocks and other materials. (ESS1-HS-5, ESS1-HS-6)
PS3.D: Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life
 • Nuclear Fusion processes in the center of the sun release the energy that ultimately reaches Earth as radiation. (ESS1-HS-1)

 • Atoms of each element emit and absorb characteristic frequencies of light. These characteristics allow identification of the presence of an
     element, even in microscopic quantities. (ESS1-HS-2)
ESS2-HS Earth’s Systems
                                                                  Performance Standards
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
ESS2-HS-1.     Develop a model to illustrate how Earth’s internal and surface processes operate at different spatial and temporal scales to form
continental and ocean-floor features.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how the appearance of land features (such as mountains, valleys, and plateaus) and sea-floor features
     (such as trenches, ridges, and seamounts) are a result of both constructive forces (such as volcanism, tectonic uplift, and orogeny) and
     destructive mechanisms (such as weathering, mass wasting, and coastal erosion).
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include memorization of the details of the formation of specific geographic features of Earth’s surface.
ESS2-HS-2.     Analyze geoscience data to make the claim that one change to Earth’s surface can create feedbacks that cause changes to other
Earth systems.
 • Further Explanation: Examples should include climate feedbacks, such as how an increase in greenhouse gases causes a rise in global
     temperatures that melts glacial ice, which reduces the amount of sunlight reflected from Earth’s surface, increasing surface temperatures and
     further reducing the amount of ice. Examples could also be taken from other system interactions, such as how the loss of ground vegetation
     causes an increase in water runoff and soil erosion; how dammed rivers increase groundwater recharge, decrease sediment transport, and
     increase coastal erosion; or how the loss of wetlands causes a decrease in local humidity that further reduces the wetland extent.
ESS2-HS-3.     Develop a model based on evidence of Earth’s interior to describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on both a one-dimensional model of Earth, with radial layers determined by density, and a three-dimensional
     model, which is controlled by mantle convection and the resulting plate tectonics. Examples of evidence include maps of Earth’s three-
     dimensional structure obtained from seismic waves, records of the rate of change of Earth’s magnetic field (as constraints on convection in
     the outer core), and identification of the composition of Earth’s layers from high-pressure laboratory experiments.
ESS2-HS-4.     Use a model to describe how variations in the flow of energy into and out of Earth’s systems result in changes in climate.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of the causes of climate change differ by timescale, over 1-10 years: large volcanic eruption, ocean circulation;
     10-100s of years: changes in human activity, ocean circulation, solar output; 10-100s of thousands of years: changes to Earth's orbit and the
     orientation of its axis; and 10-100s of millions of years: long-term changes in atmospheric composition.
 • Content Limit: Assessment of the results of changes in climate is limited to changes in surface temperatures, precipitation patterns, glacial ice
     volumes, sea levels, and biosphere distribution.
ESS2-HS-5.     Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials and surface processes.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on mechanical and chemical investigations with water and a variety of solid materials to provide the
     evidence for connections between the hydrologic cycle and system interactions commonly known as the rock cycle. Examples of mechanical
March 2018                                                                                               Science Content Standards / Academics / SDE / 73


     investigations include stream transportation and deposition using a stream table, erosion using variations in soil moisture content, or frost
     wedging by the expansion of water as it freezes. Examples of chemical investigations include chemical weathering and recrystallization (by
     testing the solubility of different materials) or melt generation (by examining how water lowers the melting temperature of most solids).
ESS2-HS-6.      Develop a quantitative model to describe the cycling of carbon among the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on modeling biogeochemical cycles that include the cycling of carbon through the ocean, atmosphere, soil,
     and biosphere (including humans), providing the foundation for living organisms.
ESS2-HS-7.      Construct an argument based on evidence about the simultaneous coevolution of Earth’s systems and life on Earth.
 • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the dynamic causes, effects, and feedbacks between the biosphere and Earth’s other systems, whereby
     geoscience factors control the evolution of life, which in turn continuously alters Earth’s surface. Examples of include how photosynthetic life
     altered the atmosphere through the production of oxygen, which in turn increased weathering rates and allowed for the evolution of animal
     life; how microbial life on land increased the formation of soil, which in turn allowed for the evolution of land plants; or how the evolution of
     corals created reefs that altered patterns of erosion and deposition along coastlines and provided habitats for the evolution of new life forms.
 • Content Limit: Assessment does not include a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of how the biosphere interacts with all of
     Earth’s other systems.
                                                                  Supporting Content
ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System
 • Cyclical changes in the shape of Earth’s orbit around the sun, together with changes in the tilt of the planet’s axis of rotation, both occurring
     over hundreds of thousands of years, have altered the intensity and distribution of sunlight falling on the earth. These phenomena cause a
     cycle of ice ages and other gradual climate changes. (ESS2-HS-4)
ESS2.A: Earth Materials and Systems
 • Earth’s systems, being dynamic and interacting, cause feedback effects that can increase or decrease the original changes. (ESS2-HS-1, ESS2-
     HS-2)
 • Evidence from deep probes and seismic waves, reconstructions of historical changes in Earth’s surface and its magnetic field, and an
     understanding of physical and chemical processes lead to a model of Earth with a hot but solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a solid mantle
     and crust. Motions of the mantle and its plates occur primarily through thermal convection, which involves the cycling of matter due to the
     outward flow of energy from Earth’s interior and gravitational movement of denser materials toward the interior. (ESS2-HS-3)
 • The geological record shows that changes to global and regional climate can be caused by interactions among changes in the sun’s energy
     output or Earth’s orbit, tectonic events, ocean circulation, volcanic activity, glaciers, vegetation, and human activities. These changes can
     occur on a variety of time scales from sudden (e.g., volcanic ash clouds) to intermediate (ice ages) to very long-term tectonic cycles. (ESS2-HS-
     4)
ESS2.B: Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions
 • The radioactive decay of unstable isotopes continually generates new energy within Earth’s crust and mantle, providing the primary source of
     the heat that drives mantle convection. Plate tectonics can be viewed as the surface expression of mantle convection. (ESS2-HS-3)
March 2018                                                                                                   Science Content Standards / Academics / SDE / 74


 •   Plate tectonics is the unifying theory that explains the past and current movements of the rocks at Earth’s surface and provides a framework
     for understanding its geologic history. Plate movements are responsible for most continental and ocean-floor features and for the distribution
     of most rocks and minerals within Earth’s crust. (ESS2-HS-1)
ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth’s Surface Processes
 • The abundance of liquid water on Earth’s surface and its unique combination of physical and chemical properties are central to the planet’s
     dynamics. These properties include water’s exceptional capacity to absorb, store, and release large amounts of energy, transmit sunlight,
     expand upon freezing, dissolve and transport materials, and lower the viscosities and melting points of rocks. (ESS2-HS-5)
ESS2.D: Weather and Climate
 • The foundation for Earth’s global climate systems is the electromagnetic radiation from the sun, as well as its reflection, absorption, storage,
     and redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and land systems, and this energy’s re-radiation into space. (ESS2-HS-2, ESS2-HS-4)
 • Gradual atmospheric changes were due to plants and other organisms that captured carbon dioxide and released oxygen. (ESS2-HS-6, ESS2-
     HS-7)
 • Changes in the atmosphere due to human activity have increased carbon dioxide concentrations and thus affect climate. (ESS2-HS-6, ESS2-HS-
     4)
ESS2.E: Biogeology
 • The many dynamic and delicate feedbacks between the biosphere and other Earth systems cause a continual co-evolution of Earth’s surface
     and the life that exists on it. (ESS2-HS-7)
PS4.A: Wave Properties
 • Geologists use seismic waves and their reflection at interfaces between layers to probe structures deep in the planet. (ESS2-HS-3)
ESS3-HS Earth and Human Activity
                                                                 Performance Standards
Students who demonstrate understanding can:
ESS3-HS-1.      Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and
changes in climate have influenced human activity.
 • Further Explanation: Examples of key natural resources include access to fresh water (such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater), regions of
     fertile soils such as river deltas, and high concentrations of minerals and fossil fuels. Examples of natural hazards can be from interior
     processes (such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes), surface processes (such as tsunamis, mass wasting and soil erosion), and severe
     weather (such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts). Examples of the results of changes in climate that can affect populations or drive mass
     migrations include changes to sea level, regional patterns of temperature and precipitation, and the types of crops and livestock that can be
     raised.
March 2018                                                                                                  Science Content Standards / Academics / SDE / 75


ESS3-HS-2.     Evaluate competing design solutions for developing, managing, and utilizing energy and mineral resources based on cost-benefit
ratios.
  • Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the conservation, recycling, and reuse of resources (such as minerals and metals) where possible, and on
     minimizing impacts where it is not. Examples include developing best practices for agricultural soil use, mining (for coal, tar sands, and oil
     shales), and pumping (for petroleum and natural gas). Science knowledge indicates what can happen in natural systems—not what should
     happen.
ESS3-HS-3.     Create a computational simulation to illustrate the relationships among management of natural resources, the sustainability of
human populations, and biodiversity.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of factors that affect the management of natural resources include costs of resource extraction and waste
     management, per-capita consumption, and the development of new technologies. Examples of factors that affect human sustainability
     include agricultural efficiency, levels of conservation, and urban planning.
  • Content Limit: Assessment for computational simulations is limited to using provided multi-parameter programs or constructing simplified
     spreadsheet calculations.
ESS3-HS-4.     Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of data on the impacts of human activities could include the quantities and types of pollutants released,
     changes to biomass and species diversity , or areal changes in land surface use (such as for urban development, agriculture and livestock, or
     surface mining). Examples for limiting future impacts could range from local efforts (such as reducing, reusing, and recycling resources) to
     large-scale geoengineering design solutions (such as altering global temperatures by making large changes to the atmosphere or ocean).
ESS3-HS-5.     Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate of
global or regional climate change and associated future impacts to Earth systems.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of evidence, for both data and climate model outputs, are for climate changes (such as precipitation and
     temperature) and their associated impacts (such as on sea level, glacial ice volumes, or atmosphere and ocean composition).
  • Content Limit: Assessment is limited to one example of a climate change and its associated impacts.
ESS3-HS-6.     Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those relationships are being
modified due to human activity.
  • Further Explanation: Examples of Earth systems to be considered are the hydrosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, and/or
     biosphere . A n example of the far- reaching impacts from a human activity is how an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide results in an
     increase in photosynthetic biomass on land and an increase in ocean acidification, with resulting impacts on sea organism health and marine
     populations.
  • Content Limit: Assessment does not include running computational representations but is limited to using the published results of scientific
     computational models.

ESS2.D: Weather and Climate
 • Current models project that, without human intervention, average global temperatures will continue to rise. The outcomes projected by
     global climate models depend on the amounts of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere each year and by the ways in which these gases
     are stored by Earth’s systems. (ESS3-HS-6)
ESS3.A: Natural Resources
 • Resource availability has guided the development of human society. (ESS3-HS-1)
 • All forms of energy production and other resource extraction have associated economic, social, environmental, and geopolitical costs and risks
     as well as benefits. New technologies and social regulations can change the balance of these factors. (ESS3-HS-2)
ESS3.B: Natural Hazards
 • Natural hazards and other geologic events have shaped the course of human history. They have altered the sizes of human populations and
     have driven human migrations. (ESS3-HS-1)
ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems
 • The sustainability of human societies and the biodiversity that supports them requires responsible management of natural resources. (ESS3-
     HS-3)
 • Scientists and engineers can make major contributions by developing technologies that produce less pollution and waste and that preclude
     ecosystem degradation. (ESS3- HS-4)
 • Though the magnitudes of human impacts are greater than they have ever been, so too are human abilities to model, predict, and manage
     current and future impacts. (ESS3-HS-5)
 • Through computer simulations and other studies, important discoveries are still being made about how the ocean, the atmosphere, and the
     biosphere interact and are modified in response to human activities. (ESS3-HS-6)
ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions
 • When evaluating solutions, it is important to take into account a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, and to
     consider social, cultural, environmental impacts. (ESS3-HS-2, ESS3-HS-4)
