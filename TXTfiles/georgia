                              Science Georgia Standards of Excellence
First Grade Standards
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The First Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science engage students in raising questions
about the world around them and seeking answers by making observations. First graders use
whole numbers to analyze scientific data. They identify how magnets pull on all things made of
iron and either attract or repel other magnets. First graders create drawings that correctly depict
something being described. The students are asked to plan and carry out simple investigations to
understand patterns (shadows, sound, weather, and daily needs of plants and animals) observed
in the world around them and make predictions based on these investigations. They follow safety
rules.

The Physical Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue student
investigations of the physical sciences that began in grades K-8, and provide students the
necessary skills to have a richer knowledge base in physical science. The standards in this course
are designed as a survey of the core ideas in the physical sciences. Those core ideas will be
studied in more depth during in the chemistry and physics courses. The physical science
standards include abstract concepts such as the conceptualization of the structure of atoms and
the role they play in determining the properties of materials, motion and forces, the conservation
of energy and matter, wave behavior, electricity, and the relationship between electricity and
magnetism. The idea of radioactive decay is limited to the understanding of whole half-lives and
how a constant proportional rate of decay is consistent with declining measures that only
gradually approach to zero. Students investigate physical science concepts through the study of
phenomena, experiences in laboratory settings, and field work.

In this course, students will recognize key features of the major body plans that have evolved in
animals and how those body plans have changed over time resulting in the diversity of animals
that are evident today.
In addition to classification and recognition, this course teaches students about the anatomical
and physiological characteristics of animals. These characteristics relate to how an animal
functions and can help students see the connections uniting particular animal groups. An
understanding of form and function allows students to study how animals have evolved over time
and to relate animals to their particular role in an ecosystem.
Finally, students will develop an understanding that all living things are interconnected.
Students should realize that the worldwide activities of humans can contribute to animal
diversity both positively and negatively. It should also be understood that humans are dependent
on animal species for advances in medicine, ecosystem maintenance, and food supply.

Physics Standards
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Physics Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue the student investigations
of the physical sciences that began in grades K-8, and provide students the necessary skills to be
proficient in physics. These standards include more abstract concepts such as nuclear decay
processes, interactions of matter and energy, velocity, acceleration, force, energy, momentum,
properties and interactions of matter, electromagnetic and mechanical waves, and electricity,
magnetism and their interactions. Students investigate physics concepts through experiences in
laboratories and field work using the science and engineering practices of asking questions and
defining problems, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations,
analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematics and computational thinking, constructing
explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining,
evaluating, and communicating information.

The Seventh Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science are designed to give all students
the necessary skills for a smooth transition from elementary life science standards to high school
biology standards. The purpose is to give all students an overview of common strands in life
science including, but not limited to, diversity of living organisms, structure and function of
cells, heredity, ecosystems, and biological evolution.
Seventh grade students keep records of their observations, use those records to analyze the data
they collect, recognize patterns in the data, use simple charts and graphs to represent the
relationships they see, and find more than one way to interpret their findings. They make and use
observations to explain the diversity of living organisms and how the organisms are classified,
how they reproduce and how genetic information is passed from parents to their offspring. They
use different models to represent systems such as cells, tissues, and organs. They use what they
know about ecosystems to explain how matter cycles and energy flows through the ecosystem.
They use the concepts of natural selection and fossil evidence to construct explanations about the
diversity of life that they see. Seventh graders plan and carry out investigations, describe
observations, and show information in graphical form. The students replicate investigations and
compare results to find similarities and differences.

                              Science Georgia Standards of Excellence
Eighth Grade Standards
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Eighth Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science are designed to give all students
the necessary skills for a smooth transition from elementary physical science standards to high
school physical science standards. The purpose is to give all students an overview of common
strands in physical science including, but not limited to, the nature of matter, conservation of
energy, energy transformations, conservation of matter, kinematics, and dynamics. These
standards are not intended in any way to take the place of the high school physical science
standards.
Eighth grade students keep records of their observations, use those records to analyze the data
they collect, recognize patterns in the data, use simple charts and graphs to represent the
relationships they see, and find more than one way to interpret their findings. They develop
conceptual understanding of the laws of conservation of matter and conservation of energy, are
able to explain the characteristics of the motion of an object (speed, acceleration) and the way
that forces may change the state of motion of an object. They use what they observe to explain
the difference between physical and chemical changes and cause and effect relationships
between force, mass, and the motion of objects. Students in eighth grade construct explanations
based on evidence on the difference and similarities between electromagnetic and mechanical
waves. Eighth graders plan and carry out investigations, describe observations, and show
information in graphical form. The students replicate investigations and compare results to find
similarities and differences.

The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The standards presented in this document are created to guide the teacher through a course in
botany that allows the student to feel confident at an introductory level for this field. These
standards are meant to motivate students toward a genuine interest in botany and its related fields
with possible job interests for the future. The skills a student masters through this coursework
should help to prepare them for a related occupation, demonstrate proficiency in a college course
of the same nature, and enrich their skill level for any additional science courses. Students should
gain an ability to notice plants in their own environment, recognize the importance of plants to
the planet and in human affairs, as well as appreciate the unique biological features of plants.

The Chemistry Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue student investigations
of the physical sciences that began in grades K-8 and provide students the necessary skills to be
proficient in chemistry. These standards include more abstract concepts such as the structure of
atoms, structure and properties of matter, the conservation and interaction of energy and matter,
and the use of Kinetic Molecular Theory to model atomic and molecular motion in chemical and
physical processes. Students investigate chemistry concepts through experiences in laboratories
and field work using the process of inquiry.
Chemistry students use the periodic table to help with the identification of elements with
particular properties, recognize patterns that lead to explain chemical reactivity and bond
formation. They use the IUPAC nomenclature in order to predict chemical names for ionic
(binary and ternary), acidic, and inorganic covalent compounds, and conduct experiments to
manipulate factors that affect chemical reactions.

Chemistry Standards
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Chemistry Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue student investigations
of the physical sciences that began in grades K-8 and provide students the necessary skills to be
proficient in chemistry. These standards include more abstract concepts such as the structure of
atoms, structure and properties of matter, the conservation and interaction of energy and matter,
and the use of Kinetic Molecular Theory to model atomic and molecular motion in chemical and
physical processes. Students investigate chemistry concepts through experiences in laboratories
and field work using the process of inquiry.
Chemistry students use the periodic table to help with the identification of elements with
particular properties, recognize patterns that lead to explain chemical reactivity and bond
formation. They use the IUPAC nomenclature in order to predict chemical names for ionic
(binary and ternary), acidic, and inorganic covalent compounds, and conduct experiments to
manipulate factors that affect chemical reactions.

                                  SCIENCE - Entomology
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Entomology Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue student
investigations that began in grades K-8 and high school biology. To achieve the goal of
entomological literacy these standards provide students with basic understanding of insect
biology as it relates to agriculture, animal and human health, ecosystem functioning and
monitoring, and insect products. Students will investigate these entomological concepts through
laboratory and field experience using the processes of inquiry.

   webs (i.e., as herbivores, predators, and scavengers) and the need for conservation.
b. Ask questions to compare and contrast the prevalence of specific insect species in local
   Georgia regions.
c. Use mathematics and computational thinking to compare species diversity and biomass in
   different terrestrial habitats and evaluate why insects dominate both measures in most regions

   ten largest insect orders (e.g., Odonata, Lepidoptera, Homoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera,
   Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Blattodea, Siphonaptera).
   (Clarification statement: This could include how some insects have evolved to control
   reproduction favoring female or “queen” survival.)

   (e.g., the Black Plague during the Middle Ages, and malaria in world history including
   Georgia).
   (Clarification statement: Demonstrate that the spread of diseases is based on species
   survivability in certain habitats, e.g. – Zika, because of the carrying species inability to
   survive in colder climates.)

   parasitoids, predators, and herbivores).
   (Clarification statement: Instruction should include both the biocontrol efforts that have
   worked as well as those that have failed or had unintended consequences (e.g., insect
   biocontrol agents preying on beneficial insects instead of the target insect)).
e. Plan and carry out an investigation of the benefits and risks of using genetically modified
   crops to manage insect pests.
f. Design an environmentally friendly solution to pest control (e.g., repellents and traps).

Earth Systems Standards
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Earth Systems Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue student
investigations that began in K-8 Earth Science and Life Science curricula on the connections
among Earth’s systems through Earth history. These systems – the atmosphere, hydrosphere,
geosphere, and biosphere – interact through time to produce the Earth’s landscapes, ecology, and
resources. These standards engage the students in constructing explanations of phenomena
fundamental to the sciences of geology and physical geography, including the early history of the
Earth, plate tectonics, landform evolution, the Earth’s geologic record, weather and climate, and
the history of life on Earth. Instruction should focus on development of scientific explanations,
rather than mere descriptions of phenomena. Case studies, laboratory exercises, maps, and data
analysis should be integrated into units. Special attention should be paid to topics of current
interest (e.g., recent earthquakes, tsunamis, global warming, price of resources) and to potential
careers in the geosciences.

The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Forensic Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to build upon science
concepts from previous courses and apply science to the investigation of crime scenes. Students
will learn the scientific protocols for analyzing a crime scene, chemical and physical separation
methods to isolate and identify materials, how to analyze biological evidence, and the criminal
use of tools, including impressions from firearms, tool marks, arson, and explosive evidence.

The geology course is designed to lead the student toward a successful understanding of
introductory geologic science. The goal of this course is to provide students with a basic
understanding of geology, geologic processes, and how geology impacts our society. The
curriculum investigates the Earth’s formation, Earth materials and processes, available and
important resources, changing landscapes and climate, catastrophic events, and society’s attempt
to deal with our ever-changing world. Students can make real-world connections by examining
our role in the solar system, man’s effect upon our mineral and rock resources, seismic events,
landforms and how a changing climate has the ability to alter life as we know it, thus applying
their knowledge to these real-world situations.

The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The geology course is designed to lead the student toward a successful understanding of
introductory geologic science. The goal of this course is to provide students with a basic
understanding of geology, geologic processes, and how geology impacts our society. The
curriculum investigates the Earth’s formation, Earth materials and processes, available and
important resources, changing landscapes and climate, catastrophic events, and society’s attempt
to deal with our ever-changing world. Students can make real-world connections by examining
our role in the solar system, man’s effect upon our mineral and rock resources, seismic events,
landforms and how a changing climate has the ability to alter life as we know it, thus applying
their knowledge to these real-world situations.

The Kindergarten Georgia Standards of Excellence for science engage students in raising
questions about the world around them. Though not developmentally ready for in-depth
explanations, kindergarten students wonder why things move and note the various patterns in
their movement (e.g., the sun and the moon appear and disappear in the sky). Students learn to
use whole numbers to describe scientific data and how to identify parts of things (i.e. tools and
toys). Kindergarteners use their senses (sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound) to group objects
and to make observations about the physical world by describing, comparing, and sorting items
according to physical attributes (i.e. number, shape, texture, size, weight, color, and motion).
They learn to follow rules to stay safe.

Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Kindergarten Georgia Standards of Excellence for science engage students in raising
questions about the world around them. Though not developmentally ready for in-depth
explanations, kindergarten students wonder why things move and note the various patterns in
their movement (e.g., the sun and the moon appear and disappear in the sky). Students learn to
use whole numbers to describe scientific data and how to identify parts of things (i.e. tools and
toys). Kindergarteners use their senses (sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound) to group objects
and to make observations about the physical world by describing, comparing, and sorting items
according to physical attributes (i.e. number, shape, texture, size, weight, color, and motion).
They learn to follow rules to stay safe.

The meteorology course is designed to build on the foundation laid by the Earth systems and
Earth science courses. Students will learn that Earth is a dynamic system and Earth’s atmosphere
is a result of processes that took millions of years. The learner then takes this knowledge of the
composition and characteristics of Earth’s atmosphere and transfers it to delve into the factors
that can cause short term and long term changes in Earth’s atmospheric conditions. Students will
learn that the Earth is an interacting system of both energy and matter. To understand the
interaction, students must build on prior knowledge of matter and the factors the affect its
behavior. In addition, throughout this course students will use science inquiry skills,
manipulation of appropriate lab equipment and demonstration of appropriate safety practices.

minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The First Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science engage students in raising questions
about the world around them and seeking answers by making observations. First graders use
whole numbers to analyze scientific data. They identify how magnets pull on all things made of
iron and either attract or repel other magnets. First graders create drawings that correctly depict
something being described. The students are asked to plan and carry out simple investigations to
understand patterns (shadows, sound, weather, and daily needs of plants and animals) observed
in the world around them and make predictions based on these investigations. They follow safety
rules.

The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.

The Second Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science engage students in raising
questions and seeking answers about the world around them by making observations and
exploring phenomena. At the appropriate times, students will ask, “How do you know?” and
will attempt to answer the question. They will use whole numbers as well as basic fractions (such
as one-half and one-fourth) to identify and analyze scientific data. Second graders will find sums
and differences of single digit numbers and then justify the answer. They will give rough
estimates to problems and estimate lengths, weights, and time intervals. They will explain to
others how to solve numerical problems related to a science activity.
Second grade students push, pull, and manipulate things to see what will happen. They study the
changing patterns of the moon and the sun and its effects on Earth. Second graders conduct
simple investigations to understand that no matter how parts of an object are assembled their
overall weight is the same as the total weight of the parts. They understand that heating and
cooling cause changes in the properties of the materials. They observe changes caused by
weather, plants, animals, and humans to the environment and study the life cycle of different
organisms.

                              Science Georgia Standards of Excellence
Fourth Grade Standards
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Fourth Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science engage students in constructing
meaningful models that allow them to gain understanding of the natural world. They speculate
about observations they make. They add, subtract, multiply and divide whole numbers on paper,
mentally, and with calculators. They list common materials for making simple mechanical
constructions and for repairing things. Fourth graders gather and interpret data and use records,
tables, or graphs to identify patterns of change. They write instructions and make sketches that
allow others to carry out a scientific investigation. They determine whether or not a comparison
is fair if conditions are different for each thing being compared. They question claims or
statements made by people outside their field of expertise. The students will use these skills to
compare and contrast the physical attributes of stars and planets, model the effects of the relative
motion of the Earth and moon around the sun, use weather charts/maps to predict weather events,
conduct investigations about the water cycle and understand their relationship with heat energy,
communicate information about the nature of light and sound, study the effects of balanced and
unbalanced forces on an object, and describe the flow of energy in an ecosystem and the roles
organisms play in a community.

explanations emphasize evidence and begin to use scientific principles, models, and theories.
Fifth graders keep records of investigations and observations and understand why they should
not alter records. They use numerical data to describe and compare objects, convert the fractions
to decimals in scientific calculations, and identify the largest and smallest possible value of
something. They use reference books, magazines or newspapers, and computer databases to

Sixth Grade Standards
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge
and skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for
Science Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as
the core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The
Science Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and
inquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required
minimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend
beyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge
about the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient
understanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science
and engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.
Technology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be
foremost in instruction.
The Sixth Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science are designed to give all students an
overview of common strands in earth science including, but not limited to, meteorology,
geology, astronomy, and oceanography.
Sixth grade students use records they keep and analyze the data they collect, plan and carry out
investigations, describe observations, and show information in different forms. They are able to
recognize relationships in simple charts and graphs and find more than one way to interpret their
findings. They replicate investigations and compare results to find similarities and differences.
Sixth graders study weather patterns and systems by observing and explaining how an aspect of
weather can affect a weather system. They are able to construct explanations based on evidence
of the role of water in Earth processes, recognize how the presence of land and water in
combination with the energy from the sun affect the climate and weather of a region. They use
different models to represent systems such as the solar system and the sun/moon/Earth system.
They study uses and conservation of Earth’s natural resources and use what they observe about
the Earth’s materials to infer the processes and timelines that formed them.

The Seventh Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science are designed to give all students
the necessary skills for a smooth transition from elementary life science standards to high school
biology standards. The purpose is to give all students an overview of common strands in life
science including, but not limited to, diversity of living organisms, structure and function of
cells, heredity, ecosystems, and biological evolution.
Seventh grade students keep records of their observations, use those records to analyze the data
they collect, recognize patterns in the data, use simple charts and graphs to represent the
relationships they see, and find more than one way to interpret their findings. They make and use
observations to explain the diversity of living organisms and how the organisms are classified,
how they reproduce and how genetic information is passed from parents to their offspring. They
use different models to represent systems such as cells, tissues, and organs. They use what they
know about ecosystems to explain how matter cycles and energy flows through the ecosystem.
They use the concepts of natural selection and fossil evidence to construct explanations about the
diversity of life that they see. Seventh graders plan and carry out investigations, describe
observations, and show information in graphical form. The students replicate investigations and
compare results to find similarities and differences.

S7L5. Obtain, evaluate, and communicate information from multiple sources to explain the
theory of evolution of living organisms through inherited characteristics.
a. Use mathematical representations to evaluate explanations of how natural selection leads to
   changes in specific traits of populations over successive generations.
   (Clarification statement: Referencing data should be obtained from multiple sources
   including, but not limited to, existing research and simulations. Students should be able to
   calculate means, represent this data in a table or graph, and reference it when explaining the
   principles of natural selection.)

b. Construct an explanation based on evidence that describes how genetic variation and
   environmental factors influence the probability of survival and reproduction of a species.
c. Analyze and interpret data for patterns in the fossil record that document the existence,
   diversity, and extinction of organisms and their relationships to modern organisms.
   (Clarification statement: Evidence of evolution found in comparisons of current/modern
   organisms such as homologous structures, DNA, and fetal development will be addressed in
   high school.)
