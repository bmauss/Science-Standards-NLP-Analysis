Flatiron School Capstone Project 


## Summary:  
In April of 2013 a collection of rigorous, and internationally benchmarked standards for K-12 science education standards called [Next Generation Science Standards (NGS)](https://www.nextgenscience.org/) were released. These standards were crafted to prepare students to be better decision makers about scientific and technical issues and to apply science to their daily lives.  

By blending core science knowledge with scientific practices, students are engaged in a more relevant context that deepens their understanding and helps them to build what they need to move forward with their education. However these standards were of voluntary adoption at the time and many states chose not to change their current (common core) standards. 

While many of the disperate state standards currently used have general alignment with the NGS standards discrepency in sequency or grade level often make it difficult for educators to allign NGS resources to their teaching units. 

This project seeks to use KMeans clustering, NLP, and Neural Networks in conjunction with a Dash to build a tool that allows teachers to easily identify which NGS standards most closely align with their state specific standard and thus effeciently access resources, framework and core ideas for meaningful implementation in the classroom. Additionally this tool could be used by building level, district level, or state level administrators to move standards into alignment with NGS standards.
