#### Summary:  
In April of 2013 a collection of rigorous, and internationally benchmarked standards for K-12 science education standards were released called [Next Generation Science Standards (NGS)](https://www.nextgenscience.org/) . These standards were crafted to prepare students to be better decision makers about scientific and technical issues and to apply science to their daily lives.  

By blending core science knowledge with scientific practices, students are engaged in a more relevant context that deepens their understanding and helps them to build what they need to move forward with their education. However these standards were of voluntary adoption at the time and many states chose not to change their current (common core) standards. 

Currently 18 states have adopted the NGS fully for their K -12 science curriculum, 26 are 'aligned' to the NGS standards and 8 have independently developled standards. 'Alligning with' or 'aligned to' are terms often used by rarely quantified. By identifying word freqencies and text patterns in the NGS standards and comparing them to state standards that claim to be aligned to them, this project aims not only to provide insight into the similarities and differences of science education across America but also develop a tool that could be used more broadly to measure alignment.
