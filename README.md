#### Summary:  
In April of 2013 a collection of rigorous, and internationally benchmarked standards for K-12 science education standards were released called [Next Generation Science Standards (NGS)](https://www.nextgenscience.org/) . These standards were crafted to prepare students to be better decision makers about scientific and technical issues and to apply science to their daily lives. By blending core science knowledge with scientific practices, students are engaged in a more relevant context that deepens their understanding and helps them build what they need to move forward with their education. However, these standards were of voluntary adoption at the time and many states chose not to change their current (common core) standards.

Currently, 18 states have fully adopted the NGSS for their K -12 science curriculum, 26 are 'aligned' to the NGS standards and eight have independently developed standards. Much qualitative work is done to measure alignment. Each of these states deployed teams of industry experts to spend months to achieve this alignment. Yet little quantitative work has been applied to understand alignment. With the surge in tools provided in the Natural Language Processing package, the idea that an organization could quantify its alignment is within reach. By identifying word frequencies and text patterns in the NGSS standards and comparing them to state standards, this project aims to do just that, providing not only insight into the similarities and differences of science education across America, but also develop a tool that could be used more broadly to quantify alignment cross industry. 


### Data: 
31 K-12 science standards documents. The states that have fully adopted the NGSS standards do not have unique documents for comparison and thus are represented in the NGSS standards exploration and examination. 

These documents contain specific langauge about content standards, as well as writing on overaching goals and themes the standards wish to highlight. These documents shed light into not only what content a state's Department of Education deems important but also how it talks (and thus thinks) about itself.  

### NGSS Standard Exploration & Sentiment Analysis 
From the processed corpus the most frequently occuring words in the document are:
