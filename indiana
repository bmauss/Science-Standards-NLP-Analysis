Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
The Science and Engineering Process Standards are the processes and skills that students are
expected to learn and be able to do within the context of the science content. The separation of the
Science and Engineering Process Standards from the Content Standards is intentional; the
separation of the standards explicitly shows that what students are doing while learning science is
extremely important. The Process Standards reflect the way in which students are learning and doing
science and are designed to work in tandem with the science content, resulting in robust
instructional practice.

                          A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct conceptual
                          models that illustrate ideas and explanations. Models are used to develop
                          questions, predictions and explanations; analyze and identify flaws in systems;
                          build and revise scientific explanations and proposed engineered systems; and
                          communicate ideas. Measurements and observations are used to revise and
                          improve models and designs. Models include, but are not limited to: diagrams,

                          other technological tools.
                          Scientists and engineers are constructing and performing investigations in the
                          field or laboratory, working collaboratively as well as individually. Researching
                          analogous problems in order to gain insight into possible solutions allows
                          them to make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution. A plan

investigations            identified variables and parameters generating quality data. While performing,
                          scientists and engineers monitor and record progress. After performing, they
                          evaluate to make changes to modify and repeat the investigation if necessary.

                      Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive meaning.
                      Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious, scientists and
                      engineers use a range of tools to identify the significant features in the data.

                      fundamental tools for representing physical variables and their relationships.
                      They are used for a range of tasks such as constructing simulations; solving

thinking              of such predictions. Scientists and engineers understand how mathematical
                      ideas interconnect and build on one another to produce a coherent whole.
                      Scientists and engineers use their results from the investigation in constructing
SEPS.6 Constructing   descriptions and explanations, citing the interpretation of data, connecting the
explanations (for     investigation to how the natural and designed world(s) work. They construct

                      Scientists and engineers use reasoning and argument based on evidence to
                      identify the best explanation for a natural phenomenon or the best solution to
                      a design problem. Scientists and engineers use argumentation, the process by

Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
The Science and Engineering Process Standards are the processes and skills that students are
expected to learn and be able to do within the context of the science content. The separation of the
Science and Engineering Process Standards from the Content Standards is intentional; the
separation of the standards explicitly shows that what students are doing while learning science is
extremely important. The Process Standards reflect the way in which students are learning and doing
science and are designed to work in tandem with the science content, resulting in robust
instructional practice.

                    Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive
                    meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious, scientists

 Content Standards
 For the high school science courses, the content standards are organized around the core ideas in
 each particular course. Within each core idea are indicators which serve as the more detailed
 expectations within each of the content areas.

Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
The Science and Engineering Process Standards are the processes and skills that students are
expected to learn and be able to do within the context of the science content. The separation of the
Science and Engineering Process Standards from the Content Standards is intentional; the
separation of the standards explicitly shows that what students are doing while learning science is
extremely important. The Process Standards reflect the way in which students are learning and doing
science and are designed to work in tandem with the science content, resulting in robust
instructional practice.

Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
The Science and Engineering Process Standards are the processes and skills that students are
expected to learn and be able to do within the context of the science content. The separation of the
Science and Engineering Process Standards from the Content Standards is intentional; the
separation of the standards explicitly shows that what students are doing while learning science is
extremely important. The Process Standards reflect the way in which students are learning and doing
science and are designed to work in tandem with the science content, resulting in robust
instructional practice.
                          Science and Engineering Process Standards
  SEPS.1 Posing           A practice of science is posing and refining questions that lead to
  questions (for          descriptions and explanations of how the natural and designed world(s)
  science) and            work and these questions can be scientifically tested. Engineering
  defining problems       questions clarify problems to determine criteria for possible solutions
  (for engineering)       and identify constraints to solve problems about the designed world.
                          A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct
                          conceptual models that illustrate ideas and explanations. Models are
                          used to develop questions, predictions and explanations; analyze and
                          identify flaws in systems; build and revise scientific explanations and
                          proposed engineered systems; and communicate ideas. Measurements
                          and observations are used to revise and improve models and designs.
                          Models include, but are not limited to: diagrams, drawings, physical

  and tools
                          Another practice of both science and engineering is to identify and
                          correctly use tools to construct, obtain, and evaluate questions and
                          problems. Utilize appropriate tools while identifying their limitations.
                          Tools include, but are not limited to: pencil and paper, models, ruler, a
                          protractor, a calculator, laboratory equipment, safety gear, a spreadsheet,
                          experiment data collection software, and other technological tools.
                          Scientists and engineers are constructing and performing investigations
                          in the field or laboratory, working collaboratively as well as individually.
                          Researching analogous problems in order to gain insight into possible
  SEPS.3                  solutions allows them to make conjectures about the form and meaning

  investigations          systematically encompasses identified variables and parameters
                          generating quality data. While performing, scientists and engineers
                          monitor and record progress. After performing, they evaluate to make
                          changes to modify and repeat the investigation if necessary.

                     Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive
                     meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious,
                     scientists and engineers use a range of tools to identify the significant
                     features in the data. They identify sources of error in the investigations

 and interpreting
                     and engineering makes analysis of proposed solutions more efficient and
 data
                     effective. They analyze their results by continually asking themselves
                     questions; possible questions may be, but are not limited to: “Does this
                     make sense?” "Could my results be duplicated?" and/or “Does the
                     design solve the problem with the given constraints?”
                     In both science and engineering, mathematics and computation are
                     fundamental tools for representing physical variables and their
                     relationships. They are used for a range of tasks such as constructing
 SEPS.5 Using
                     simulations; solving equations exactly or approximately; and recognizing,
 mathematics and
                     expressing, and applying quantitative relationships. Mathematical and
 computational
                     computational approaches enable scientists and engineers to predict the
 thinking
                     behavior of systems and test the validity of such predictions. Scientists
                     and engineers understand how mathematical ideas interconnect and build
                     on one another to produce a coherent whole.

                     Scientists and engineers use reasoning and argument based on evidence
                     to identify the best explanation for a natural phenomenon or the best
                     solution to a design problem. Scientists and engineers use argumentation,
 SEPS.7 Engaging in  the process by which evidence-based conclusions and solutions are

 evidence            methods based on merits. Scientists and engineers engage in

                     solution, resolving questions about measurements, building data models,
                     and using evidence to evaluate claims.
                     Scientists and engineers need to be communicating clearly and
                     articulating the ideas and methods they generate. Critiquing and
 SEPS.8 Obtaining,   communicating ideas individually and in groups is a critical professional
 evaluating, and     activity. Communicating information and ideas can be done in multiple
 communicating       ways: using tables, diagrams, graphs, models, and equations, as well as,
 information         orally, in writing, and through extended discussions. Scientists and
                     engineers employ multiple sources to obtain information that is used to
                     evaluate the merit and validity of claims, methods, and designs.

                                         converted from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed.
                                         Env.2.3 Recognize and explain that the amount of life any environment can support is
                                         limited by the available energy, water, oxygen, nutrients and minerals, and by the ability of
                                         ecosystems to recycle organic materials from the remains of dead organisms.
 Standard 2: Flow of Matter and Energy
                                         Env.2.4 Recognize and describe the different sources of energy, including fossil fuels,
                                         nuclear, and alternative sources of energy provided by water, wind, geothermal,
                                         biomass/biofuels, and the sun.

                                         gradually turned into great coal beds and oil pools by the pressure of the overlying earth.
                                         Recognize that by burning these fossil fuels, people are passing stored energy back into
                                         the environment as heat and releasing large amounts of matter such as carbon dioxide and
                                         other air pollutants.

                                 and disadvantages that society must question when considering the trade-offs among
                                 them, such as how energy use contributes to the rising standard of living in the industrially
                                 developing nations. However, explain that this energy use also leads to more rapid
                                 depletion of Earth’s energy resources and to environmental risks associated with the use
                                 of fossil and nuclear fuels.
                                 Env.2.9 Describe how decisions to slow the depletion of energy sources through efficient
                                 technologies can be made at many levels, from personal to national, and these
                                 technologies involve trade-offs of economic costs and social values.
                                 Env.2.10 Understand and describe how nuclear reactions release energy without the
                                 combustion products of burning fuels, but that the radioactivity of fuels and by-products
                                 poses other risks which may last for thousands of years. Understand and assess the uses
                                 of nuclear fission and fusion, including the implications for society.
                                 Env.2.11 Recognize and describe the role of natural resources in providing the raw
                                 materials for an industrial society.
                                 Env.3.1 Identify and describe geomorphic processes controlled by tectonics (i.e. volcanic
                                 activity, uplift, and shaping of landforms).

Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
The Science and Engineering Process Standards are the processes and skills that students are
expected to learn and be able to do within the context of the science content. The separation of the
Science and Engineering Process Standards from the Content Standards is intentional; the
separation of the standards explicitly shows that what students are doing while learning science is
extremely important. The Process Standards reflect the way in which students are learning and doing
science and are designed to work in tandem with the science content, resulting in robust
instructional practice.
                          Science and Engineering Process Standards
  SEPS.1 Posing           A practice of science is posing and refining questions that lead to
  questions (for          descriptions and explanations of how the natural and designed world(s)
  science) and            work and these questions can be scientifically tested. Engineering
  defining problems       questions clarify problems to determine criteria for possible solutions
  (for engineering)       and identify constraints to solve problems about the designed world.
                          A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct
                          conceptual models that illustrate ideas and explanations. Models are
                          used to develop questions, predictions and explanations; analyze and
                          identify flaws in systems; build and revise scientific explanations and
                          proposed engineered systems; and communicate ideas. Measurements
                          and observations are used to revise and improve models and designs.
                          Models include, but are not limited to: diagrams, drawings, physical
  SEPS.2 Developing
                          replicas, mathematical representations, analogies, and other technological
  and using models
                          models.
  and tools
                          Another practice of both science and engineering is to identify and
                          correctly use tools to construct, obtain, and evaluate questions and
                          problems. Utilize appropriate tools while identifying their limitations.
                          Tools include, but are not limited to: pencil and paper, models, ruler, a
                          protractor, a calculator, laboratory equipment, safety gear, a spreadsheet,
                          experiment data collection software, and other technological tools.
                          Scientists and engineers are constructing and performing investigations
                          in the field or laboratory, working collaboratively as well as individually.
                          Researching analogous problems in order to gain insight into possible
  SEPS.3                  solutions allows them to make conjectures about the form and meaning
  Constructing and        of the solution. A plan to a solution pathway is developed prior to
  performing              constructing and performing investigations. Constructing investigations
  investigations          systematically encompasses identified variables and parameters
                          generating quality data. While performing, scientists and engineers
                          monitor and record progress. After performing, they evaluate to make
                          changes to modify and repeat the investigation if necessary.

                     Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive
                     meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious,
                     scientists and engineers use a range of tools to identify the significant
                     features in the data. They identify sources of error in the investigations
 SEPS.4 Analyzing
                     and calculate the degree of certainty in the results. Advances in science
 and interpreting
                     and engineering makes analysis of proposed solutions more efficient and
 data
                     effective. They analyze their results by continually asking themselves
                     questions; possible questions may be, but are not limited to: “Does this
                     make sense?” "Could my results be duplicated?" and/or “Does the
                     design solve the problem with the given constraints?”
                     In both science and engineering, mathematics and computation are
                     fundamental tools for representing physical variables and their
                     relationships. They are used for a range of tasks such as constructing
 SEPS.5 Using
                     simulations; solving equations exactly or approximately; and recognizing,
 mathematics and
                     expressing, and applying quantitative relationships. Mathematical and
 computational
                     computational approaches enable scientists and engineers to predict the
 thinking
                     behavior of systems and test the validity of such predictions. Scientists
                     and engineers understand how mathematical ideas interconnect and build
                     on one another to produce a coherent whole.
                     Scientists and engineers use their results from the investigation in
 SEPS.6

                     the available evidence.
                     Scientists and engineers use reasoning and argument based on evidence
                     to identify the best explanation for a natural phenomenon or the best
                     solution to a design problem. Scientists and engineers use argumentation,
 SEPS.7 Engaging in  the process by which evidence-based conclusions and solutions are
 argument from       reached, to listen to, compare, and evaluate competing ideas and
 evidence            methods based on merits. Scientists and engineers engage in
                     argumentation when investigating a phenomenon, testing a design
                     solution, resolving questions about measurements, building data models,
                     and using evidence to evaluate claims.
                     Scientists and engineers need to be communicating clearly and
                     articulating the ideas and methods they generate. Critiquing and
 SEPS.8 Obtaining,   communicating ideas individually and in groups is a critical professional
 evaluating, and     activity. Communicating information and ideas can be done in multiple
 communicating       ways: using tables, diagrams, graphs, models, and equations, as well as,
 information         orally, in writing, and through extended discussions. Scientists and
                     engineers employ multiple sources to obtain information that is used to
                     evaluate the merit and validity of claims, methods, and designs.

                                Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. Differentiate between low, medium (including our sun), and
                                high mass stars by what elements can be produced, and therefore whether or not they can
                                achieve red giant phase or go supernova.
                                ES.1.5 Illustrate the hierarchical relationship and scales of stars, planetary systems including
                                multiple-star systems, star clusters, galaxies, and galactic groups in the universe.
                                ES.2.1 Construct a flowchart with diagrams and descriptions outlining the nebular theory of
                                solar system formation. Include the formation of one or more stars, planetesimals,
                                protoplanets, Jovian and terrestrial planets, and other objects including satellites and small
                                bodies.
                                ES.2.2 Describe the characteristics of the various kinds of objects in the solar system
                                including planets, satellites, comets, asteroids, and protoplanets. Recognize that planets have
                                been identified orbiting stars other than the sun, or exist outside of solar systems orbiting no
                                sun at all. Describe the organization of our solar system including terrestrial and Jovian
                                planets, asteroid belts, and the Oort Cloud.
                                ES.2.3 Develop a model illustrating the layers and life span of the sun. Explain how nuclear
                                fusion in the core produces elements and energy, which are both retained through
                                convection and released to space, including Earth, through radiation. Additionally, elements
                                heavier than iron cannot form in stars, and form only as a result of supernovae.
                                ES.2.4 Use mathematical and/or computational representations to demonstrate the motions
 Standard 2: The Solar System
                                of the various kinds of objects in our solar system including planets, satellites, comets, and
                                asteroids. Explain that Kepler’s Laws determine the orbits of those objects and know that
                                Kepler’s Laws are a direct consequence of Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation together
                                with his laws of motion.
                                ES.2.5 Explain how scientific theory changes over time with the introduction of new
                                information and observational data. Use works from ancient Greeks such as Ptolemy, and
                                other astronomers including Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, and Galileo to demonstrate the
                                effect of observational data and scientific discussion on our understanding of the mechanics
                                and motion of our solar system.

                                              lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere, including carbon dioxide and
                                              methane. Explain how human activities such as farming and industry, temperature change in
                                              oceans, and natural processes such as volcanic eruptions can speed or slow the cycling from

                                               Earth's atmosphere. Show how carbon and oxygen cycles affect the composition through
                                               gas exchange with organisms, oceans, the solid earth, and industry.
                                               ES.4.2 Create models to demonstrate the circulation, retention, and reflection of heat in

                                ES.4.6 Differentiate between weather and climate. Examine long term, natural climate
                                change and periods of glaciation as influenced by Milankovitch Cycles due to the gravity of
                                other solar system bodies (obliquity and precession of axis and eccentricity of orbit).
                                Explain how these are different from any short term (less than thousands of years) changes

                                and monthly (spring and neap) tides. Explain how monthly tides relate to the revolution of
                                the moon, and therefore, its phases.

                               Show how each type can melt and reform igneous rock, undergo the various metamorphic
                               processes, and undergo physical and chemical weathering to form sedimentary rock.
                               ES.5.3 Construct a model that demonstrates the difference between weathering, erosion,
                               transportation of material, deposition, and new soil and sedimentary rock formation.

                               ES.5.4 Differentiate between relative and absolute geological time. Detail how sedimentary
                               rock can be dated based on relative-age dating and positioning, while igneous formations
                               can be radiometrically dated. Differentiate between radiocarbon dating used for organic
 Standard 5: The Solid Earth
                               materials and other types of radiometric dating for inorganic rock formation.

                               mostly sedimentary bedrock. Explain how changing sea levels, climate, and glaciation have
                               shaped Indiana geology.
                               ES.5.6 Create models or diagrams to show how plate movement and sea level changes have
                               changed continental land masses over time. Include the creation and destruction of inland
                               seas, sedimentary rock formations including evaporites and biochemical formations, and the
                               shaping and destruction of surface features.

                               properties of the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core of Earth.
                               ES.6.2 Explain how Earth's fluid outer core creates the magnetosphere and how this helps
                               protect both humans and technology (such as satellites) from solar winds.
                               ES.6.3 Construct a diagram and explanation showing the convection of Earth's mantle and
                               its impact on the movements of tectonic plates. Explain how the decay of radioactive
                               isotopes and residual energy from Earth's original formation provide the heat to fuel this
                               convective process, which, along with ridge push and slab pull, drive the movements of
                               tectonic plates.

                               and explain how the evidence from the theory of continental drift, seafloor spreading, and
                               paleomagnetism built upon each other to support tectonic plate theory.
                               ES.6.5 Create models that demonstrate different types of orogeny resulting from plate
                               tectonics. Show how the interactions between oceanic and continental plates create different
                               geological features (such as volcanic island arcs or high altitude plateaus) depending on what
                               types of plates are involved in the motions along different plate boundaries.
                               ES.6.6 Create models and differentiate between shield, composite, and cinder cone
                               volcanoes. Explain how volcanoes form, how the chemical composition of lava affects the
                               type of volcanoes formed, and how the location (such as hot spots or along continental or
                               oceanic margins) can affect the types of magma present.

                               ES.6.7 Use models, diagrams, and captions to explain how tectonic motion creates
                               earthquakes and tsunamis. Using resources such as indianamap.org, analyze how close the
                               school is to known faults and liquefaction potential. Differentiate between intraplate fault
                               zones such as the Wabash Valley Fault System and the more commonly discussed faults
                               along tectonic margins.
                               ES.6.8 Create an action plan detailing what to do in an emergency if an earthquake occurred
                               near the school or home. Detail what should be kept in an earthquake preparation kit, how
                               to prepare homes for earthquake safety, and what actions should be taken during and after
                               an earthquake to ensure personal safety.

Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
The Science and Engineering Process Standards are the processes and skills that students are
expected to learn and be able to do within the context of the science content. The separation of the
Science and Engineering Process Standards from the Content Standards is intentional; the
separation of the standards explicitly shows that what students are doing while learning science is
extremely important. The Process Standards reflect the way in which students are learning and doing
science and are designed to work in tandem with the science content, resulting in robust
instructional practice.
                        Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
SEPS.1 Posing              A practice of science is posing and refining questions that lead to
questions (for             descriptions and explanations of how the natural and designed world(s)
science) and               work and these questions can be scientifically tested. Engineering
defining problems          questions clarify problems to determine criteria for possible solutions and
(for engineering)          identify constraints to solve problems about the designed world.
                           A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct
                           conceptual models that illustrate ideas and explanations. Models are used
                           to develop questions, predictions and explanations; analyze and identify
                           flaws in systems; build and revise scientific explanations and proposed
                           engineered systems; and communicate ideas. Measurements and
                           observations are used to revise and improve models and designs. Models
SEPS.2 Developing          include, but are not limited to: diagrams, drawings, physical replicas,
and using models           mathematical representations, analogies, and other technological models.
and tools
                           Another practice of both science and engineering is to identify and
                           correctly use tools to construct, obtain, and evaluate questions and
                           problems. Utilize appropriate tools while identifying their limitations.
                           Tools include, but are not limited to: pencil and paper, models, ruler, a
                           protractor, a calculator, laboratory equipment, safety gear, a spreadsheet,
                           experiment data collection software, and other technological tools.
                           Scientists and engineers are constructing and performing investigations in
                           the field or laboratory, working collaboratively as well as individually.
                           Researching analogous problems in order to gain insight into possible
SEPS.3                     solutions allows them to make conjectures about the form and meaning of
Constructing and           the solution. A plan to a solution pathway is developed prior to
performing                 constructing and performing investigations. Constructing investigations
investigations             systematically encompasses identified variables and parameters generating
                           quality data. While performing, scientists and engineers monitor and
                           record progress. After performing, they evaluate to make changes to
                           modify and repeat the investigation if necessary.
Chemistry                                              1     Indiana Academic Standards for Science 2016


                    Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive
                    meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious,
                    scientists and engineers use a range of tools to identify the significant
                    features in the data. They identify sources of error in the investigations and

Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
The Science and Engineering Process Standards are the processes and skills that students are
expected to learn and be able to do within the context of the science content. The separation of the
Science and Engineering Process Standards from the Content Standards is intentional; the
separation of the standards explicitly shows that what students are doing while learning science is
extremely important. The Process Standards reflect the way in which students are learning and doing
science and are designed to work in tandem with the science content, resulting in robust
instructional practice.
                        Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
SEPS.1 Posing              A practice of science is posing and refining questions that lead to
questions (for             descriptions and explanations of how the natural and designed world(s)
science) and               work and these questions can be scientifically tested. Engineering
defining problems          questions clarify problems to determine criteria for possible solutions and
(for engineering)          identify constraints to solve problems about the designed world.
                           A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct
                           conceptual models that illustrate ideas and explanations. Models are used
                           to develop questions, predictions and explanations; analyze and identify
                           flaws in systems; build and revise scientific explanations and proposed
                           engineered systems; and communicate ideas. Measurements and
                           observations are used to revise and improve models and designs. Models
SEPS.2 Developing          include, but are not limited to: diagrams, drawings, physical replicas,
and using models           mathematical representations, analogies, and other technological models.
and tools
                           Another practice of both science and engineering is to identify and
                           correctly use tools to construct, obtain, and evaluate questions and
                           problems. Utilize appropriate tools while identifying their limitations.
                           Tools include, but are not limited to: pencil and paper, models, ruler, a
                           protractor, a calculator, laboratory equipment, safety gear, a spreadsheet,
                           experiment data collection software, and other technological tools.
                           Scientists and engineers are constructing and performing investigations in
                           the field or laboratory, working collaboratively as well as individually.
                           Researching analogous problems in order to gain insight into possible
SEPS.3                     solutions allows them to make conjectures about the form and meaning of
Constructing and           the solution. A plan to a solution pathway is developed prior to
performing                 constructing and performing investigations. Constructing investigations
investigations             systematically encompasses identified variables and parameters generating
                           quality data. While performing, scientists and engineers monitor and
                           record progress. After performing, they evaluate to make changes to
                           modify and repeat the investigation if necessary.

                    Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive
                    meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious,
                    scientists and engineers use a range of tools to identify the significant
                    features in the data. They identify sources of error in the investigations and

                    In both science and engineering, mathematics and computation are
                    fundamental tools for representing physical variables and their
                    relationships. They are used for a range of tasks such as constructing
SEPS.5 Using
                    simulations; solving equations exactly or approximately; and recognizing,
mathematics and
                    expressing, and applying quantitative relationships. Mathematical and
computational
                    computational approaches enable scientists and engineers to predict the
thinking

                    engineers understand how mathematical ideas interconnect and build on

                    Scientists and engineers use reasoning and argument based on evidence to
                    identify the best explanation for a natural phenomenon or the best solution
                    to a design problem. Scientists and engineers use argumentation, the

                    a phenomenon, testing a design solution, resolving questions about
                    measurements, building data models, and using evidence to evaluate claims.
                    Scientists and engineers need to be communicating clearly and articulating
                    the ideas and methods they generate. Critiquing and communicating ideas
SEPS.8 Obtaining,   individually and in groups is a critical professional activity. Communicating

communicating       graphs, models, and equations, as well as, orally, in writing, and through
information         extended discussions. Scientists and engineers employ multiple sources to
                    obtain information that is used to evaluate the merit and validity of claims,
                    methods, and designs.

Content Standards
For the high school science courses, the content standards are organized around the core ideas in
each particular course. Within each core idea are indicators which serve as the more detailed
expectations within each of the content areas.

Science and Engineering Process Standards (SEPS)
The Science and Engineering Process Standards are the processes and skills that students are
expected to learn and be able to do within the context of the science content. The separation of the
Science and Engineering Process Standards from the Content Standards is intentional; the
separation of the standards explicitly shows that what students are doing while learning science is
extremely important. The Process Standards reflect the way in which students are learning and doing
science and are designed to work in tandem with the science content, resulting in robust
instructional practice.

                            A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct
                            conceptual models that illustrate ideas and explanations. Models are

                         Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive
                         meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious,
                         scientists and engineers use a range of tools to identify the significant
                         features in the data. They identify sources of error in the investigations

                         questions; possible questions may be, but are not limited to: “Does this
                         make sense?” "Could my results be duplicated?" and/or “Does the
                         design solve the problem with the given constraints?”
                         In both science and engineering, mathematics and computation are
                         fundamental tools for representing physical variables and their
                         relationships. They are used for a range of tasks such as constructing

                         and using evidence to evaluate claims.
                         Scientists and engineers need to be communicating clearly and
                         articulating the ideas and methods they generate. Critiquing and

                     A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct
                     conceptual models that illustrate ideas and explanations. Models are used
                     to develop questions, predictions and explanations; analyze and identify
                     flaws in systems; build and revise scientific explanations and proposed

                     Another practice of both science and engineering is to identify and
                     correctly use tools to construct, obtain, and evaluate questions and
                     problems. Utilize appropriate tools while identifying their limitations.
                     Tools include, but are not limited to: pencil and paper, models, ruler, a
                     protractor, a calculator, laboratory equipment, safety gear, a spreadsheet,
                     experiment data collection software, and other technological tools.
                     Scientists and engineers are constructing and performing investigations in

                     record progress. After performing, they evaluate to make changes to
                     modify and repeat the investigation if necessary.
                     Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive
                     meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious,
                     scientists and engineers use a range of tools to identify the significant
                     features in the data. They identify sources of error in the investigations and

                     questions; possible questions may be, but are not limited to: “Does this
                     make sense?” "Could my results be duplicated?" and/or “Does the design
                     solve the problem with the given constraints?”

questions (for       descriptions and explanations of how the natural and designed world(s)

defining problems    questions clarify problems to determine criteria for possible solutions and
(for engineering)    identify constraints to solve problems about the designed world.
                     A practice of both science and engineering is to use and construct
                     conceptual models that illustrate ideas and explanations. Models are used
                     to develop questions, predictions and explanations; analyze and identify
                     flaws in systems; build and revise scientific explanations and proposed
                     engineered systems; and communicate ideas. Measurements and
                     observations are used to revise and improve models and designs. Models

and using models     mathematical representations, analogies, and other technological models.
and tools
                     Another practice of both science and engineering is to identify and
                     correctly use tools to construct, obtain, and evaluate questions and
                     problems. Utilize appropriate tools while identifying their limitations.
                     Tools include, but are not limited to: pencil and paper, models, ruler, a
                     protractor, a calculator, laboratory equipment, safety gear, a spreadsheet,
                     experiment data collection software, and other technological tools.
                     Scientists and engineers are constructing and performing investigations in
                     the field or laboratory, working collaboratively as well as individually.
                     Researching analogous problems in order to gain insight into possible

investigations       systematically encompasses identified variables and parameters generating
                     quality data. While performing, scientists and engineers monitor and
                     record progress. After performing, they evaluate to make changes to
                     modify and repeat the investigation if necessary.
                     Investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive
                     meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious,
                     scientists and engineers use a range of tools to identify the significant
                     features in the data. They identify sources of error in the investigations and

and interpreting
                     engineering makes analysis of proposed solutions more efficient and
data
                     effective. They analyze their results by continually asking themselves
                     questions; possible questions may be, but are not limited to: “Does this
                     make sense?” "Could my results be duplicated?" and/or “Does the design
                     solve the problem with the given constraints?”

                    In both science and engineering, mathematics and computation are
                    fundamental tools for representing physical variables and their
                    relationships. They are used for a range of tasks such as constructing

                    Scientists and engineers need to be communicating clearly and articulating

communicating       graphs, models, and equations, as well as, orally, in writing, and through
information         extended discussions. Scientists and engineers employ multiple sources to
                    obtain information that is used to evaluate the merit and validity of claims,
                    methods, and designs.

   Physical Science (PS)
   K.PS.1 Plan and conduct an investigation using all senses to describe and classify different kinds
   of objects by their composition and physical properties. Explain these choices to others and
   generate questions about the objects.
   K.PS.2 Identify and explain possible uses for an object based on its properties and compare
   these uses with other students’ ideas.
   K.PS.3 Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or
   different directions of pushes and pulls on the motion of an object.
   K.PS.4 Analyze data to determine if a design solution works as intended to change the speed or
   direction of an object with a push or a pull.
   Earth and Space Science (ESS)
   K.ESS.1 Make observations to determine the effect of sunlight on Earth’s surface and use tools
   and materials to design and build a structure to reduce the warming effect on Earth's surface.
   K.ESS.2 Describe and compare objects seen in the night and day sky, observing that the sun and
   moon move across the sky.
   K.ESS.3 Investigate the local weather conditions to describe patterns over time.
   K.ESS.4 Communicate solutions that will reduce the impact of humans on the land, water, air,
   and/or other living things in the local environment.
   Life Science (LS)
   K.LS.1 Describe and compare the growth and development of common living plants and
   animals.
   K.LS.2 Describe and compare the physical features of common living plants and animals.
   K.LS.3 Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans)
   need to survive.
